They have filed a habeas petition asking the court to stop the government from removing them from the United States the Alien Enemies Act Presidential Proclamation, and to declare the Proclamation unlawful. The case has been brought on behalf of themselves and a class of all other persons similarly situated, to include all noncitizens from Venezuela in immigration custody in the Southern District of New York, who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation.\nThe court has temporarily blocked the Defendants from removing the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the Southern District of New York through Apr. 23, 2025.\nCase Summary: On March 15, 2025, President Donald Trump published a Presidential Proclamation titled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua” (Proclamation), which sought to authorize removal of noncitizens from Venezuela who are deemed to be “enemy aliens” under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). \nPetitioners are two Venezuelan men who have been arrested and detained by immigration authorities, and allegedly face imminent deportation pursuant to the Proclamation. \nPetitioners argue that the removal process established under the Proclamation is unlawful. They argue that such process is ultra vires under the AEA, as the AEA only authorizes removals during a declared war or invasion of the United States by a foreign nation or government, and further requires additional process prior to removing noncitizens. They also argue that the removal process violates various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, including those that establish procedures and mechanisms for, as well as protections against, removal (including sending someone to a country where they are more likely than not to face torture). Finally, they argue that the removal process violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the right to habeas corpus. \nPetitioners have brought their petition and complaint on behalf of a similarly situated class, including all noncitizens in immigration custody who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation.\nPetitioners have requested that the court certify the class, grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Defendants from removing them pursuant to the Proclamation, and declare the Proclamation unlawful.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, the court certified the class and granted a temporary restraining order preventing their removal from the district or the United States.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 17, petitioners filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction. The reply asserts that the government has not satisfied due process requirements under the AEA and that the proclamation violates both procedural requirements and Congressionally established protections for noncitizens seeking humanitarian protections.",

The White House publicly released the proclamation on the afternoon of Mar. 15. Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit arguing the 1798 statute does not apply to these circumstances, and the judge provisionally agreed issuing a temporary block to any removals until further hearings. The Court of Appeals upheld the judge’s ruling on appeal. The district court issued two Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) against the government on Mar. 15 that have been extended through Apr. 12.\nSummary: On Mar. 14, President Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang.\nIn the early hours of Saturday, Mar. 15, five Venezuelan nationals in U.S. immigration custody brought a proposed class action lawsuit challenging the government’s action on the ground that the Alien Enemies Act does not provide authority for such removals; that the removals would be in violation of immigration statutes governing deportation proceedings and the Administrative Procedure Act, in addition to a violation of habeas corpus.

A class of individuals in US immigration custody seek a writ of habeas corpus to prevent their removal to El Salvador and a declaration that the presidential proclamation is unlawful. The court denied petitioners’ initial request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on Apr. 17 and petitioners filed a renewed emergency TRO request on Apr. 18.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, President Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang.\nOn Apr. 16, two Venezuelan individuals using the pseudonyms A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. who are in U.S. immigration custody, filed a habeas petition against Respondents-Defendants Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and others. A.A.R.P and W.M.M. claim to be at imminent risk of removal under the AEA and ask that the court assume jurisdiction over the matter, grant class certification, issue a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo, and enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners and the class of those similarly situated from the district during the pendency of the litigation. \nPetitioners argue that the government's actions are ultra vires, a violation of the Immigration and Naturalization Act which provides a “sole basis” for such removals, provisions for applying for asylum and withholding, statutory protection against being sent to a country where they could face torture, and the Fifth Amendment due process clause and the right to habeas.\nPetitioners also ask the court to declare the President’s Proclamation unlawful, grant a writ of habeas corpus enjoining Respondents from removing Petitioners from the district pursuant to the Proclamation, and prevent Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Respondents without giving 30-days’ advance notice and opportunity to respond. Petitioners contend that the Supreme Court in Trump v. J.G.G. vacated a nationwide temporary restraining order that applied to Petitioners, but made clear that review of the Petitioners’ claims was available by habeas and that Petitioners are entitled to due process and reasonable notice in advance of removal. Petitioners assert that the government has made clear that it believes Petitioners are members of TdA and may give them as little as 24 hours notice prior to removal. They argue that the Proclamation is unlawful and that the court’s intervention is necessary so that Petitioners and the putative class are not unlawfully sent to a Salvadoran prison pursuant to the Proclamation. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, Judge James Wesley Hendrix denied the Petitioners’ motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge wrote, “The United States answered unequivocally, stating that ‘the government does not presently expect to remove A.A.R.P. or W.M.M. under the [Aliens Enemies Act] until after the pending habeas petition is resolved’ and that ‘[i]f that changes, we will update the Court.’” The court reserved a decision on class certification.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 18, Petitioners submitted a renewed emergency TRO request. Petitioners state, “officers at Bluebonnet have distributed notices under the Alien Enemies Act, in English only, that designate Venezuelan men for removal under the AEA, and have told the men that the removals are imminent and will happen tonight or tomorrow” (emphasis in original).\n\nPlaintiffs also submitted an appeal at the same time to the Fifth Circuit as an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe district court rejected the motion on the ground that the appeal divested the court of jurisdiction.\n\nUpdate 3: On late Friday night, Apr. 18, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the emergency appeal. Around 1AM on Saturday, Apr. 19, the Supreme Court issued a stay writing, “The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.” Justices Alito and Thomas dissented.",

Petitioners state, “officers at Bluebonnet have distributed notices under the Alien Enemies Act, in English only, that designate Venezuelan men for removal under the AEA, and have told the men that the <em>removals are imminent and will happen tonight or tomorrow</em>” (emphasis in original).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaintiffs also submitted an <a href=\"https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/04/Emergency-Motion.pdf\">appeal</a> at the same time to the Fifth Circuit as an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1007/356063/20250418172902261_2025.04.18%20AARP%20Application.pdf\">appeal</a> to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe district court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.402915/gov.uscourts.txnd.402915.41.0.pdf\">rejected</a> the motion on the ground that the appeal divested the court of jurisdiction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Update 3</strong>: On late Friday night, Apr. 18, the Fifth Circuit <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25902120-aarporder041825/\">dismissed</a> the emergency appeal. Around 1AM on Saturday, Apr. 19, the Supreme Court issued a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041925zr_c18e.pdf\">stay</a> writing, “The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.” Justices Alito and Thomas dissented.</br>",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (Abrego Garcia) and his family sued several government officials alleging his Mar. 15 deportation to El Salvador without judicial proceedings was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Withholding of Removal Statute, and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs allege the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE paid the government of El Salvador to incarcerate 261 U.S. noncitizens, including Abrego Garcia, who were deported on Mar. 15. Abrego Garcia and his family request that the government’s actions be declared a violation of the Fifth Amendment and that the Court order the government to work with the government of El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody. At the heart of his claim is that he was under court protection barring his removal to El Salvador, and the government has acknowledged his removal was an “administrative error.” The district court has ordered his return to the United States, and the Court of Appeals has affirmed that order.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 15, the U.S. government deported 261 noncitizens to El Salvador. Among those removed was Plaintiff Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (Abrego Garcia), who had been granted immigration relief in 2019 through withholding of removal to El Salvador on the ground that he had a well-grounded fear of persecution. Plaintiffs include Abrego Garcia, his U.S. citizen wife, and his child. Plaintiffs allege the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE provided substantial financial compensation to the Government of El Salvador to incarcerate Abrego Garcia and the other noncitizens deported with him. Plaintiffs contend that the removal of Abrego Garcia to El Salvador constitutes a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Withholding of Removal Statute, and the procedural and substantive due process rights safeguarded under the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration affirming that the removal of Abrego Garcia was unconstitutional. They further request that the court direct the defendants to cease compensating El Salvador for the detention of Abrego Garcia and order the defendants to formally request the release of Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody, and take all reasonable measures to facilitate his return to the United States in the event El Salvador fails to comply.\nPlaintiffs immediately filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) urging the court to immediately prohibit the defendants from continuing payments to the Government of El Salvador for Abrego Garcia's detention and to require the defendants to initiate efforts to secure his return to U.S. custody.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 25, Judge Paula Xinis denied Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a TRO. \nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a second motion for a TRO against the Defendants requesting injunctive relief in the form of a court order preventing Defendants from continuing to financially support El Salvador’s detention of Abrego Garcia and ordering Defendants to request the return of Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the requested injunctive relief.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a TRO. The Defendants state it was an “administrative error” to have removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, but oppose the relief that Plaintiffs request.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Judge Paula Xinis wrote that “issuance of a preliminary injunction without further delay is necessary … to avoid ongoing irreparable harm,” and ordered the government to effectuate his return to the United States by 11:59PM Apr. 7. The judge published a memorandum opinion on Apr. 6. \nUpdate 5: The Defendants appealed the order, and on the morning of Apr. 7, the Fourth Circuit denied the Defendants’ request for a stay. The Defendants petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the district court order and an immediate administrative stay. Chief Justice Roberts issued a temporary stay and ordered the Plaintiff to submit a reply by 5pm ET the following day. The Plaintiff, however, submitted their reply shortly afterwards on the same day. \nUpdate 6: On the evening of Apr. 10, the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion without any dissent, upheld the district court order in large part. The Court wrote: “The order properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador. The intended scope of the term ‘effectuate’ in the District Court’s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court’s authority.”\nWithin hours, the district court issued an order “to DIRECT that Defendants take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.” The order also required the government to provide a declaration with information of Abrego Garcia’s current location and steps taken to facilitate his return.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, Defendants submitted a Response to the Order stating that the government could not provide information in response to the Apr. 10 order by the designated time of 9:30AM ET on Apr. 11.\nAfter a hearing in which the government did not provide answers, the judge issued an Order stating “counsel [for the Defendant] could not confirm, and thus did not advance any evidence, that Defendants had done anything to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. This remained Defendants’ position even after this Court reminded them that the Supreme Court of the United States expressly affirmed this Court’s authority to require the Government ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s return” (emphasis in original). The order requires the Defendant to provide a daily update of actions taken to facilitate his return.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 12, the government submitted a declaration stating only that “Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador. He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.”\nEarlier that day Plaintiffs submitted a motion for additional relief including expedited discovery. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 13, the Defendants provided a daily status report, which included no information on efforts to obtain his release from custody in El Salvador. The Defendants also submitted a motion opposing the Plaintiffs’ Apr. 12 motion for additional relief. The motion also stated, “Defendants understand ‘facilitate’ to mean … actions allowing an alien to enter the United States … best read as taking all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here” (emphasis in original).\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 15, Judge Xinis granted the motion for expedited discovery. The Judge wrote, “Defendants therefore remain obligated, at a minimum, to take the steps available to them toward\naiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and\nresuming his status quo ante. But the record reflects that Defendants have done nothing at all.”\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 16, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal.\nUpdate 21: On Apr. 17, the Fourth Circuit denied the Defendant’s appeal in a 7-page order.\n",

A federal court temporarily blocked the EO while the lawsuit is pending on the basis that it likely violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Trump has appealed the court’s decision. The Fourth Circuit denied the appeal, and the government then appealed to the Supreme Court. \nCase Summary: Trump’s executive order seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants on the basis that people in the United States illegally are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Four states sued to protect residents who would lose their citizenship under the executive order. The suit argues that the plain text of the 14th Amendment, as confirmed in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), explicitly grants birthright citizenship for all people born in the United States.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 23, 2025, Judge John Coughenour of the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order against the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Jan. 27, Franco Aleman v. Trump (complaint) was consolidated with this case.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 6, Judge Coughenour issued an opinion granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 6, defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court (case no. 25-807).\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 12, defendants made an emergency motion to stay the district court’s injunction. \nUpdate 6: On Feb. 19, the Ninth Circuit issued an order denying the government’s emergency motion to stay the district court’s injunction and leaving the existing briefing schedule unchanged. \nUpdate 7: On Mar. 13, the Defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a partial stay of the district court’s injunction.\n",

The lawsuit seeks to block the implementation of this guidance on the basis that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nCase Summary: Acting Attorney General Benjamine Huffman issued policy guidance that, among other immigration-related policies, instructs the Civil Division of the Department of Justice “to identify state and local laws, policies, and activities that are inconsistent with Executive Branch immigration initiatives and, where appropriate, to take legal action to challenge such laws.” The plaintiffs, Chicago-based immigrant-advocacy organizations, allege that the guidance, and subsequent raids “specifically for the purpose of ending the Plaintiffs’ Sanctuary City advocacy and movement building,” violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the Department of Justice’s guidance.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 29, Plaintiffs requested the Court’s permission to withdraw their pending motions for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs noted its motions were to prevent federal officials from threatening or executing unlawful Chicago-based immigration raids. In light of Defendants’ launching such raid, Plaintiffs note the relief to which they may be entitled has changed.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 26, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice, citing this action as “no longer the appropriate forum to seek relief.” The judge dismissed the case without prejudice.",

The lawsuit seeks to temporarily block the order on the basis that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.\nCase Summary: In 2024, Congress appropriated funds for two immigration programs, the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) and Immigration Court Helpdesk (ICH). On Jan. 22, 2025, the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) issued a stop-work order that halted funding for four programs providing legal resources to unrepresented people facing deportation. The EOIR action was taken purportedly to “audit” the programs pursuant to the Trump administration executive order. Nine advocacy and immigrant legal services organizations sued, arguing that terminating funding for the programs is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); violates the Appropriations Clause in the case of the LOP and ICH; and violates the First Amendment by denying the plaintiffs access to courthouses and immigration detention centers. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order  and preliminary injunction and to enjoin the government from stopping the programs, refusing to spend appropriated funds, preventing the plaintiffs from accessing immigration courts houses and detention centers, and removing materials and posters the plaintiffs have posted in those locations.",

On March 31, Judge Edward Chen ordered the Trump administration to postpone the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals. The Trump administration appealed the order the following day, and the Appellate Court later rejected the appeal.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 17, 2025, near the end of President Joe Biden’s term, DHS Secretary Mayorkas extended the designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans living in the United States. On Jan. 28, President Trump’s newly-confirmed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem vacated that extension, and days later she terminated TPS for Venezuelans who had first registered for protected status in 2023.\nPlaintiffs allege that DHS lacks authority to “vacate” a prior TPS extension, but even if it did have such authority, the Secretary’s justifications are “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, pretextual, and inexplicably deviate from past practice in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.” Citing Secretary Noem’s references to Venezuelan TPS holders as “dirtbags,” Plaintiffs also allege that the Secretary’s actions were motivated at least partly by racial animus, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs request that the court declare unlawful and set aside DHS’s vacatur and termination orders and reinstate the prior TPS extension.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 20, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to postpone the effective date of DHS’s vacatur and termination orders. The Plaintiffs argued they are likely to succeed on the merits because Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to vacate the extension, the vacatur was arbitrary and capricious, and the government was motivated by racial animus. They also argued that they face a risk of irreparable harm and that, on balance, the Plaintiffs and the public interest would be more harmed by the absence of a stay than the Defendants would be by the imposition of one. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, the Defendants filed a reply to the Plaintiffs’ motion to postpone the effective date. The Defendants argued that the court lacks jurisdiction to review Secretary Noem’s actions or to provide the Plaintiffs’ requested relief. They also argue that even if the court has jurisdiction, the Plaintiffs’ claims fail on the merits.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 7, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion to postpone the effective date of DHS’s orders. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 20, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding claims against Secretary Noem’s decision to reduce the 2024 TPS extension for Haiti to 12 months, and asking the court to declare that the 18-month TPS extension remains in effect. Additionally, the court held a hearing on plaintiffs’ motion to postpone the effective date of the Venezuela TPS claim on March 24 and a decision is forthcoming.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 31, Judge Edward Chen granted plaintiffs motion (in a 78-page court order) to postpone the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Defendants appealed Judge Chen’s Mar. 31 order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 18, the Ninth Circuit denied the Defendants’ motion for a stay.",

This group has requested that the court block the EO on the basis that it violates federal law and the Constitution’s Due Process Clause.\nCase Summary: The Trump administration executive order directs the Department of Homeland Security to terminate all categorical parole programs contrary to the president’s executive orders. In effect, this ended the following programs: Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), Parole Processes for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), and Operation Allies Welcome (OAW). Subsequently, on Feb. 14, Acting Deputy Director of USCIS Andrew Davidson issued a memorandum (not yet made public) to various USCIS directorates and program officers directing them not to adjudicate immigration benefit requests filed by noncitizens who are or were paroled into the United States under: U4U; CHNV; family reunification parole processes created in 2023 for nationals of Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; a family reunification parole processes for Haitians that was created in 2014 and expanded in 2023; and a family reunification parole process for Cubans that was created in 2007 and expanded in 2023.\nPlaintiffs in this class action contend that both Executive Order 14165 and the Davidson memo violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As such, Plaintiffs request an injunction in order to restore the status quo ante.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to include: additional plaintiffs; family members of affected individuals as part of the class; additional immigration parole programs; and a request that the court set aside DHS’ suspension of the adjudication of requests for parole, re-parole, and other immigration benefits. Plaintiffs also filed a motion on Mar. 17 requesting a preliminary injunction and administrative stay against DHS’ indefinite moratorium on adjudicating immigration benefit applications, on the basis that Plaintiffs would succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act and Immigration and Nationality Act claims and that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury.  \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, DHS filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification for the class action on the same day, defining the class as all individuals with pending applications to sponsor someone for humanitarian parole processes, as well as all individuals, who have received humanitarian parole through already established processes, with pending applications for additional immigration benefit. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended complaint to include: additional plaintiffs; additional factual allegations related to DHS’ Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice that terminates the parole programs for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and sets a termination date of the temporary parole period of individuals under these parole programs to April 24, 2025; and an additional claim for relief arguing that the Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice violates the Administrative Procedure Act because Plaintiffs did not receive written notice of termination of parole. On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction and administrative stay to block DHS’ early termination of the temporary parole period, as stated in the Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice. Plaintiffs argue that the termination violates the Administrative Procedure Act and request a preliminary injunction and a stay to block DHS from implementing or enforcing the termination of parole processes, on the grounds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act claim and that they will suffer irreparable injury. \nUpdate 4: On Apr. 14, Judge Indira Talwani issued an order granting class certification and another order granting a stay temporarily blocking the government’s action.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 18, Defendants filed a notice that they were appealing the court’s order staying parole terminations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

The lawsuit argues that the proclamation  violates multiple laws and Constitutional provisions. After the Trump administration agreed not to use the proclamation to deport individual asylum-seekers during the litigation, a federal judge denied the emergency motion to pause the implementation of the proclamation.\nCase Summary: Trump’s proclamation bars immigrants who arrive after the date of the proclamation from invoking provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would permit them to remain in the United States while pursuing asylum claims. The plaintiffs, three nonprofit organizations in Texas and Arizona providing legal services and assistance to undocumented individuals or asylum seekers, argue that the order violates the following statutory and constitutional provisions:\n1. the Asylum Statute in the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (by barring noncitizens from applying for asylum in direct contradiction to congressional protections);\n2. the Withholding of Removal Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (by preventing noncitizens from seeking protection from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion);\n3. the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (by depriving noncitizens of a meaningful opportunity to present CAT claims and shielding them from potential torture);\n4. the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D) (by denying unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries their statutory right to regular removal proceedings);\n5. the INA’s procedural protections for removal, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1229a, 1225(b) (by overriding mandated removal proceedings and eliminating procedural protections, including credible fear screenings);\n6. the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (by implementing policies that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law) and § 706(2)(D) (by failing to follow the required rulemaking process before enacting sweeping changes to statutory protections); and \n7. the constitutional separation of powers (by exceeding presidential authority and unlawfully overriding congressionally enacted immigration protections).\nThe Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the proclamation is unlawful and an injunction stopping its implementation.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to stay removal of individual plaintiff non-citizens who are currently detained by the Defendants and could be imminently deported under the proclamation. On Feb. 20, Judge Moss issued an administrative stay in the case until 12 pm on Feb. 24 to allow the government time to gather information to respond, and time for expedited briefing. The court further ordered the Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a stay of removal by Feb. 21.  \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 22, Judge Moss denied as moot the emergency motion to stay removal of individual asylum-seekers because the government agreed not to use President Trump’s January 2025 border proclamation to remove them during the litigation. The court ordered that the government must provide at least seven days’ notice before removing any of the plaintiffs during the case and vacated the scheduled hearing.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, the Trump administration filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting, among other things, that plaintiffs lack standing, that presidential decisions are not reviewable under the APA, and that the “[t]he determination that the United States is facing an invasion is an unreviewable political question.”",

Plaintiffs argue that the U.S. government’s actions violate the Constitution and immigration law and ask the court to allow detainees to have access to lawyers and to have their locations disclosed. \nCase Summary: Trump’s Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Plaintiffs are suing on behalf of the families of four Venezuelan nationals who are believed to have been transferred to Guantánamo. Plaintiffs allege the government’s action violates habeas corpus rights, Fifth Amendment Due Process rights, and the Immigration and Naturalization Act’s guarantee of the right to counsel. Plaintiffs further allege that the government’s alleged restriction of information in and out of Guantánamo violates both the plaintiffs’ and the detainees’ First Amendment rights. They seek court orders declaring that the government’s actions violate those rights, permitting access to lawyers, requiring the government to identify the location of detainees held at Guantánamo, requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer to a foreign jurisdiction, and requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer of additional noncitizens to Guantánamo.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 20, the government filed a notice that DHS had removed the immigration detainees from Guantánamo, which the government asserted “eliminates any need for temporary injunctive relief.” Just prior, it filed its Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order arguing, among other things, that the Plaintiffs (family members of individuals who had been held at Guantánamo, and advocacy organizations) lacked standing because they were not themselves detained, that the District Court lacked statutory authority to require the government to provide notice before transferring individuals into or out of Guantánamo, and denying the validity of Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Plaintiffs filed a Reply reasserting their request for a TRO to prevent the government from sending more detainees to Guantánamo.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a Reply explaining that in spite of the administration’s Feb. 20 notice that all immigrant detainees had been transferred off Guantánamo and the TRO was moot, they had learned via social media that another group of immigrants was being sent to Guantánamo. The Reply adds further factual allegations and legal arguments that immigrant detainees are prevented from having real meaningful access to legal representation. These include that (1) the government and guards at the detention camp do not allow detainees to make phone calls, including by saying “this is a terrorist prison and there is no capacity to make calls” and by limiting available phones and times such that most people cannot use them; (2) unrepresented detainees transferred to Guantanamo do not have access to a legal directory, know your rights briefings, or practical means to meet counsel; and (3) retained counsel face numerous obstacles to representing their clients, including that only five detainees can make phone calls each day, there are no means for attorneys to initiate contact with their clients, and there is no way to transfer or sign paperwork other than the government's announced policy to “generally follow the procedures used in the habeas litigation involving law of war detainees,” and to transfer mail to detainees from Washington, D.C. on a weekly basis. \nPlaintiffs argue that these restrictions violate detainees’ First and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as their statutory right to counsel under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as the plaintiff advocacy organizations’ First Amendment rights. \nUpdate 4: On March 19, the Defendants submitted a notice agreeing to notification before any plaintiffs would be transferred to Guantanamo.",

The lawsuit argues that these actions violate the Refugee Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and Constitutional due process rights. A federal judge has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring implementation of the EO and the notice. The Trump administration has challenged the preliminary injunction on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Ten plaintiffs — individual refugees, U.S. citizens, and resettlement organizations (HIAS, Church World Service, and Lutheran Community Services Northwest) — filed a proposed class action seeking injunctions to block implementation of the orders, declaratory judgments that the actions are unlawful, maintenance of refugee processing and resettlement services consistent with the status quo, and confirmation of compliance with such remedies if granted. The lawsuit alleges that the orders have left approved refugees stranded internationally, denied recent arrivals statutorily-mandated support services, and forced layoffs at resettlement institutions. \nThe complaint asserts that the executive orders violate the Refugee Act’s comprehensive statutory scheme for refugee policy, are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act for circumventing notice-and-comment requirements and failing to establish a reasoned basis for the change in policy, and breach agency regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 207.7 governing the Follow-to-Join process in violation of the Accardi doctrine requiring government officials to follow the agency’s own rules and procedures. The lawsuit further argues that the orders violate the Fifth Amendment due process rights of U.S. citizens petitioning for family reunification, and violate fundamental separation of powers principles by attempting to redistribute or withhold congressionally appropriated funds to achieve policy objectives.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 25, Judge Jamal Whitehead, ruling from the bench, issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the executive order. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 28, Judge Whitehead issued a written opinion granting the nationwide preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, the government submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Citing continued steps by the administration to dismantle resettlement programs after Judge Whitehead’s preliminary injunction, including the termination of cooperative agreements implementing the resettlement programs, the amended complaint also requests a TRO and preliminary injunction against implementation of the EO. The plaintiffs also submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction on the basis of this amended complaint.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 8, the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to stay the district court proceedings with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their response to this emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit on Mar. 14.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 24, the court granted a second preliminary injunction on the basis of Plaintiffs’ amended complaint.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 25, the Trump administration filed a notice that it was appealing the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.\nOn that same day, the Ninth Circuit granted in part and denied in part the emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Whitehead on Feb. 28. The Ninth Circuit denied the motion to the extent it applies to individuals who were conditionally approved for refugee status before Jan. 20, 2025, but otherwise granted the motion to stay.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 3, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the first preliminary injunction due to Defendants’ noncompliance with the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs’ motion also included an emergency motion for a show cause hearing.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 8, the Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiffs’ Apr. 3 motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, arguing Plaintiffs’ read of the Ninth Circuit’s stay order is too narrow. The Trump administration requested the court hold Plaintiffs’ motion in abeyance pending the Ninth Circuit’s ruling on their pending appeals.",

USCCB argues the Trump administration’s actions are illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act and seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from implementing the suspension. A federal judge refused to immediately stop the U.S. government’s actions but agreed to speed up the process for deciding whether to block them.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Plaintiff, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), is part of a public-private partnership with the federal government through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and was providing transitionary resettlement services to more than 6,700 refugees when the State Department suspended funding. USCCB brought suit, arguing the government policy suspending funds for the Refugee Admissions Program is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act because it (1) violates the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the Refugee Act of 1980, and the Impoundment Control Act; (2) is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and (3) is a substantive role promulgated without required notice-and-comment rulemaking. They seek a declaratory judgment that the suspension is unlawful, and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions prohibiting the government from implementing the suspension and requiring the government to make reimbursements pursuant to the terms of its cooperative agreements.\nUpdate 1: On Feb 20, 2025, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the request for a temporary restraining order, but ordered an expedited briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction motion.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, an amended motion for a preliminary injunction, and a memorandum in support of that motion; and Judge McFadden ruled that the prior motions for a preliminary injunction are moot in light of the new motion. The amended complaint and the amended motion for a preliminary injunction are in response to new developments in the case, e.g., on Feb. 27, the State Department terminated the cooperative agreements with USCCB for refugee resettlement. This termination changed the nature of the dispute from a suspension of funding to a complete cancellation of the contracts.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, the government filed in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction and the following day, on Mar. 6, the plaintiffs filed a reply.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 11, Judge McFadden denied Plaintiffs’ motion for an emergency preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 12, Plaintiffs submitted a notice of appeal to the DC Circuit.",

On Apr. 1, the Court issued an order blocking Defendants from withdrawing the services or funds provided by ORR through Apr. 16 and on Apr. 10 agreed to extend the block through Apr. 30. Defendants have appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 21, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) sent a notice (the “Cancellation Order”) terminating the funding through which the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) had provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied immigrant children and ordering nonprofits that had received such funding to “immediately stop work” on their ongoing funded representations for unaccompanied children.

California, which Defendants assert constitutes a significant shift in law affirming federal agencies’ discretion to make funding determinations.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 7, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the TRO, alleging that Defendants have not complied with the court’s order.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 10, the Court extended the TRO until Apr. 30.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, Defendants appealed the Court’s decision to grant and then extend the TRO to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",

A federal judge has declined the request for a temporary block while the case proceeds, on the basis that no information has yet been shared with DHS.\nCase Summary: Plaintiffs allege that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to collect information about individuals for potential immigration enforcement” by seeking access to data associated with individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). The IRS assigns ITINs to individuals who lack social security numbers (i.e., noncitizens) so that such individuals can file tax returns and pay federal income taxes as required by law. Plaintiffs assert that granting immigration enforcement agencies access to the sensitive data of individuals who file using ITINs would “expose millions of taxpayers to the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.” \nPlaintiffs claim the government’s actions are ultra vires and violate the Administrative Procedure Act by running afoul of the IRS statute requiring confidentiality of tax return information. \nThey seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from providing ITIN applications to DHS, ICE, the President, or any others, unless such disclosure is specifically permitted by law.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 14, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a temporary restraining order (TRO). \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 17, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO, which included a Motion to Dismiss. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a TRO.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 20, following  a hearing the day prior, Judge Dabney Friedrich denied Plaintiffs’ motion for  a TRO for failure to demonstrate  standing, likelihood of success on the merits, or irreparable harm.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding new plaintiffs–Somos un Pueblo (“Somos”) and Inclusive Action for the City (“IAC”)–to the complaint; alleging additional harms to Somos’s members, IAC’s business, and arbitrary and capricious action by Treasury Defendants; and requesting additional relief to enjoin DHS Defendants from inspecting information about Plaintiffs’ members without a court order.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 31, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that the court block Defendants from disclosing, inspecting, or using tax return information for immigration enforcement purposes except as expressly authorized by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 7, Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss and opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack the jurisdictional requirements to bring a suit and that DHS can legally request tax return information relating to individuals under criminal investigation.\nUpdate 8: On April 10, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, noting that Defendants’ opposition motion supports Plaintiffs’ position that ICE seeks tax payer data to locate and deport immigrants from the U.S.",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A green card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University involved in pro-Palestinian protests has sued the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other government officials, challenging his detention and attempted deportation by ICE agents as a violation of his constitutional rights, including the First and Fifth amendment. On Mar. 12, ICE asked the court to dismiss the case or transfer the case to Louisiana. On the same day, the court made all court files available online. The judge also ordered that Khalil be granted at least one privileged attorney-client call on Mar. 12 and at least one such call on Mar. 13. On Mar. 15, Khalil moved for a preliminary injunction. On Mar. 19, the case was transferred to the District of New Jersey. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 8, 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and lawful U.S. permanent resident (a green card holder). Khalil is a recent graduate of Columbia University, where he played a prominent role in organizing pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. (See also Declaration by Khalil’s attorney)\nThe habeas petition alleges, “At the time this proceeding was initiated, [Khalil] was detained at 26 Federal Plaza in New York, New York.”\nThe government moved Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana, away from his New York home and his wife, who is eight months pregnant and a U.S. citizen. His legal team filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the legality of his detention and deportation efforts. Khalil’s legal team also moved to compel the government to return him to the Southern District of New York (SDNY).\nOn Mar. 10, SDNY federal judge Jesse Furman temporarily blocked his removal from the United States pending further judicial review, which he extended after an emergency conference hearing on Mar. 12.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, the government submitted an declaration from ICE Acting Field Office Director of the NYC office which stated: \"At the time Khalil filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of New York, he was detained at Elizabeth Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey.\" The government filed a motion to dismiss or transfer the case to the Western District of Louisiana.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 12, Judge Jesse Furman issued an order lifting restrictions on remote access to electronic files, making all prior and future filings publicly available unless redacted or sealed. The judge also ordered that Khalil be granted at least one privileged attorney-client call on Mar. 12 and at least one such call on Mar. 13.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 14, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed his opposition to the government’s motion to dismiss or transfer the case. The filing argues that, if the court concludes it is not the proper venue for Khalil’s claims, the petition should be transferred to the District of New Jersey (not the Western District of Louisiana, as requested by the government) based on the immediate custodian rule. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 15, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil moved for his release. On Mar. 17, Khalil moved for a preliminary injunction: “(1) ordering the release of Mr. Khalil for the pendency of this litigation; (2) enjoining Respondent Rubio’s determination that the INA’s ‘Foreign Policy Ground’ applies to him for the pendency of this litigation; and (3) enjoining Respondents from enforcing their Policy of arresting, detaining, and removing noncitizens who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel for the pendency of this litigation.” \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 19, Judge Furman denied the government’s motion to dismiss the Petition, but granted the government’s motion to transfer the case, albeit to the District of New Jersey, not to the Western District of Louisiana. The case is now before Judge Michael Farbiarz.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Judge Michael Farbiarz issued an order and opinion holding the court has habeas jurisdiction over the case, and soliciting the parties’ views on appealability of the order.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 2, the government filed a motion opposing Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The government argues that Petitioner Khalil cannot meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction because they claim that: (1) Petitioner Khalil cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) Petitioner Khalil has not established irreparable harm, given that he allegedly has multiple other avenues to seek release; and (3) the public interest favors the government, given the allegedly significant public interest in swift enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. In addition, the government requests that a bond be posted should Petitioner Khalil be granted an injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 3, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed a second amended complaint. The amended complaint adds Yolanda Pittman, the warden of the detention facility where Khalil was held in New Jersey on March 9, 2025, as a defendant.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 6, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed a reply in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction. Khalil argues the government is mistaken in its claim that the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits judicial review of his challenge to his detention and the policy decisions that led to his detention. Khalil also seeks to rebut the government’s arguments that his claims are unlikely to succeed, he has not established irreparable harm, and the balance of the equities leans in favor of the government.",

In addition, the government requests that a bond be posted should Petitioner Khalil be granted an injunction.<br/>\n<strong>Update 8: </strong>On Apr. 3, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.564334/gov.uscourts.njd.564334.162.1.pdf\">filed a second amended complaint</a>. The amended complaint adds Yolanda Pittman, the warden of the detention facility where Khalil was held in New Jersey on March 9, 2025, as a defendant.<br/>\n<strong>Update 9: </strong>On Apr. 6, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.564334/gov.uscourts.njd.564334.175.0.pdf\">reply</a> in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction. Khalil argues the government is mistaken in its claim that the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits judicial review of his challenge to his detention and the policy decisions that led to his detention. Khalil also seeks to rebut the government’s arguments that his claims are unlikely to succeed, he has not established irreparable harm, and the balance of the equities leans in favor of the government.</br>",

The Plaintiffs argue that the EOs violate constitutional rights of free speech and due process and have asked the court to temporarily block the EOs to prevent visa revocations, detentions, and deportations while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) directing federal agencies to enhance immigration screening and vetting procedures to prevent the entry of individuals who may pose a terrorist, national security, or public safety threat to the U.S. On Jan. 29, Trump issued an EO directing federal resources and civil rights enforcement authorities to combat antisemitism on higher education campuses.

The academic groups argue that these actions violate the First and Fifth Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) directing federal agencies to enhance immigration screening and vetting procedures to prevent the entry of individuals who may pose a terrorist, national security, or public safety threat to the United States. On Jan. 29, the president issued an EO directing federal resources and civil rights enforcement authorities to combat antisemitism on higher education campuses. \nOn Mar. 25, Plaintiffs, the American Association of University Professors and other academic groups, filed suit against Trump, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and others, alleging that to implement these EOs, Defendants have engaged in an \"ideological-deportation policy\" against noncitizen students and faculty who participate in pro-Palestinian protests.\nPlaintiffs allege that the deportation policy creates a “climate of repression and fear on university campuses” and prevents U.S. citizen members of the academic groups from hearing from and associating with noncitizen students and colleagues, as well as making it more difficult for members to collaborate with noncitizen students and colleagues. The academic groups allege that the policy violates the First Amendment because it \"entails the arrest, detention, and deportation of noncitizen students and faculty on the basis of, or in retaliation for, their political viewpoints\" and is \"not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest.\" According to the academic groups, the policy also violates the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (as “arbitrary and capricious” conduct).

He seeks a declaration that termination without notification or an opportunity for a hearing violated his rights under the Due Process Clause as well as the Administrative Procedure Act as “arbitrary and capricious,” an order reinstating his status, and an injunction requiring that he be provided with an appropriate hearing. <br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Apr. 7, plaintiff <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293.2.0.pdf\">filed</a> a motion and accompanying <a href=\"https://www.aclu-nh.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/4.7.2025trobrief.pdf\">memorandum</a> for a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the defendants from terminating his status and requiring them to set aside the termination determination.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Apr. 10, the court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293.13.0.pdf\">granted</a> plaintiffs motion for a TRO on the basis of a violation of the APA as arbitrary and capricious.<br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Apr. 10, plaintiff filed a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/liu-v-noem-motion-for-pi.pdf\">motion</a> for a Preliminary Injunction.<br/>\n<strong>Update 4:</strong> On Apr. 17, the defendants filed a memorandum in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293/gov.uscourts.nhd.65293.15.0.pdf\">opposition</a> to the PI.</br>",

Plaintiffs claim that DHS’s practice violates multiple statutes and the Constitution. Plaintiffs asked the court to at least temporarily block deportations on an emergency basis while the case proceeds. On Mar. 28, a federal judge agreed to temporarily block this practice.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 18, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a policy directive instructing officers to review all cases of individuals previously released from immigration detention for re-dentention and removal to a “third country” (i.e., a country that differs from their countries of origin and/or citizenship). A class of noncitizens with final removal orders has sued DHS challenging the practice of deporting individuals to a third country without providing notice or opportunity to contest. Plaintiffs claim that DHS’s practice violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Convention Against Torture as implemented in domestic law. \n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment stating that DHS’s practice is unlawful and violates their statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights; seek to enjoin Defendants from failing to provide written notice and a meaningful opportunity to present a fear-based claim; and to order Defendants to return class members that have been removed to a third country. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 23, the same day the complaint was filed, Plaintiffs also filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction and stay of administrative action.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 25, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for an emergency TRO and preliminary injunction and stay of administrative action.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 28, Judge Brian Murphy granted Plaintiff’s motion for a TRO, blocking Defendants from removing individuals subject to a final order of removal from the United States to a third country, unless Defendants can show that they were provided written notice and a meaningful opportunity to present a fear-based claim.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 28, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the First Circuit.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 29, Defendants filed a Motion for partial stay of the TRO pending appeal, arguing a nationwide injunction of this kind is unlawful and improper. Judge Murphy denied this motion on the same day, citing the memorandum supporting granting of Plaintiffs’ motion for TRO.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 7, the First Circuit denied the stay on jurisdictional grounds involving the temporary status of the district court’s order. The appeals court stated that the government’s issuance of intervening Guidance Regarding Third Country Removals “made a moving target of their removal policy” that “only reinforces the temporary nature of the relief at issue.”\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 8, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in the district court in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that they are likely to succeed on the merits and that they face irreparable harm if deported to a third country without documented notice or an opportunity to present their claims before an immigration judge.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 18, Judge Murphy granted class certification and a preliminary injunction.",

Plaintiffs claim that the IFR violates the procedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). On April 11, the court denied the motion for a stay and preliminary judgement.\nCase Summary: On March 12, 2025 the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), issued an interim final rule (IFR) designating a new registration form for noncitizens to register with the Federal government. The IFR was issued to implement President Trump’s Executive Order 14159 (EO) instructing that all previously unregistered aliens had to comply with registration requirements and ensuring that failure to comply was treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority. The process created by the IFR initiates the collection of biometrics and would result in the creation of an alien registration document, and notes that existing federal regulations require noncitizens to carry proof of registration at all times. The IFR is due to go into effect on April 11.\n\nA group of nonprofit member-based organisations that provide a wide range of services to immigrant communities sued on March 31 alleging that the IFR, which is available only in English, represents the imposition of a confusing and inconsistent new universal registration scheme with attendant civil and criminal liabilities which will impact a huge number of noncitizens and irreparably harm their members. Plaintiffs allege that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (by implementing policies that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law) and § 706(2)(D) (by failing to follow the required rulemaking process, including providing public notice and opportunity to comment on legislative rules).\nThe Plaintiffs seek an order and preliminary injunction staying or postponing the effective dates of the IFR and a declaratory judgment that the IFR is unlawful and enjoining the enforcement or implementation of the rule.\nUpdate 1: On April 10 the District Court denied the motion for a stay and preliminary injunction on the basis that the Plaintiffs lack standing.

Office of Budget and Management, have now been consolidated under this case. \nCase Summary: Trump’s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Two advocacy organizations and the American Federation of Government Employees sued, arguing that the order violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which bars the delegation of decision-making authority to private citizens without public access.

The plaintiffs claim that this is the first statement about Musk's role in DOGE that can be attributed to Musk himself, which demonstrates a need for the Court to authorize requested depositions to ascertain Musk’s exact role in DOGE.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 25, Judge Jia M. Cobb denied Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery, holding that Plaintiffs lacked a pending injunction, sought broad depositions of senior officials without justification, imposed undue burden on Defendants, and requested discovery prematurely before Defendants' motion to dismiss was resolved.",

On March 18, the Court ordered DOGE to halt its dismantling of USAID and to obtain express authorization from USAID officials for all future actions taken related to USAID. On March 21, Musk and DOGE appealed this decision. \nCase Summary: Trump’s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Twenty-six current and former USAID employees or contractors filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk’s constitutional authority to exercise significant government powers as the head of DOGE without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause. The complaint alleges that Musk and the DOGE staff are exercising “significant authority” by controlling agency operations, making personnel decisions, and directing federal spending, all powers the plaintiffs claim can be wielded only by properly appointed officers of the United States. The lawsuit argues that Musk is functioning as a principal officer while evading the constitutional requirement for Senate confirmation. The plaintiffs also claim that Musk’s actions would be unconstitutional even if he were considered merely an inferior officer, as Congress has not authorized the President to directly appoint anyone to his position. The plaintiffs also argue that DOGE’s structure violates separation of powers by creating a “shadow chain of command” that undermines Congress’s power to create agencies and their authorities through statute, confirm appointed officers, and conduct oversight. The suit asks the court to declare Musk and DOGE to be acting unlawfully, enjoin Musk and DOGE from exercising government authority unless appointed by proper process, and set aside their actions taken to date.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, Defendants filed a motion in response to the request for a preliminary injunction; to which the Plaintiffs replied  on Feb. 26.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, the Court granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and risk of irreparable harm. The Court ordered DOGE to reinstate access to email, payments, security notifications, and other electronic systems. The Court did not enjoin Defendants from carrying out mass personnel and contract terminations but did enjoin them from taking further action in a number of categories such as additional personnel and contract terminations and closures of offices.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a motion for clarification or modification of the preliminary injunction order issued by the Court on Mar. 18, claiming Jeremy Lewin should not be bound by the preliminary injunction because he is no longer the DOGE Team Lead at USAID.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 20, the court denied Defendant’s motion for clarification or modification of the preliminary injunction order, confirming Lewin is bound by the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 21, Defendants appealed the Court’s preliminary injunction and denial of Defendants’ motion for clarification or modification to the Fourth Circuit. \nUpdate 7: On Mar. 25, the Court ordered that the district court’s preliminary injunction be stayed until the close of business on Thurs., Mar. 27.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 28, the Fourth Circuit granted the Defendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal.",

A federal court denied the request to temporarily block further actions by Musk and DOGE but acknowledged potential constitutional issues with Musk’s appointment and ordered Musk and DOGE to provide documents and information requested by the states.\nCase Summary: Trump’s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Fourteen states filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk’s constitutional authority to exercise significant government powers as the head of DOGE without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause. The complaint alleges that Musk and the DOGE staff are exercising “significant authority” by controlling agency operations, making personnel decisions, and directing federal spending, all powers they claim can only be wielded by properly appointed officers of the United States. The suit asks the court to declare Musk and DOGE to be acting unlawfully, impose a temporary restraining order barring Musk and DOGE from exercising government authority (including a specific list of official actions) while awaiting preliminary and permanent injunctions to the same effect, and set aside their actions taken to date. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 17, the government submitted a declaration by Joshua Fisher, Director of the Office of Administration, stating that Musk is not the head of DOGE nor an employee of DOGE.\nUpdate 2: On Feb 18, Judge Tanya Chutkan denied the Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order but also indicated a potentially favorable view of the Plaintiffs’ argument on the merits (pp. 8-9). \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, plaintiff states filed a motion for expedited discovery relating to an upcoming motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition on Feb 28. Plaintiffs filed a reply on Mar. 3. Plaintiffs’ expedited discovery motion seeks “to confirm public reporting about Defendants’ conduct, show Defendants’ future plans, and illustrate the nature and scope of the unconstitutional and unlawful authority that Defendants are exercising and will continue to imminently exercise.” The document requests and interrogatories generally concern DOGE’s and Musk’s conduct in four areas: (1) eliminating or reducing the size of federal agencies; (2) terminating or placing federal employees on leave; (3) cancelling, freezing, or pausing federal contracts, grants, or other federal funding; and (4) obtaining access, using, or making changes to federal databases or data management systems.\nUpdate 4: On Mar 7, defendants filed a motion to dismiss arguing plaintiffs lack Article III standing and have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 12, Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery and ordered Elon Musk and DOGE to produce the requested documents and respond to the interrogatories and requests for admissions in Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 14, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum opposing the Defendant’s motion to dismiss, asserting that they had already suffered financial and programmatic harm and would continue to do so absent the court’s intervention.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a memorandum supporting their motion to dismiss, reasserting that plaintiffs lack standing.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 20, the case Japanese American Citizens League v.

A federal court denied the request to temporarily block further actions by Musk and DOGE but acknowledged potential constitutional issues with Musk’s appointment and ordered Musk and DOGE to provide documents and information requested by the states.</em><br/><br>\n<strong>Case Summary: </strong>Trump’s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Fourteen states filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk’s constitutional authority to exercise significant government powers as the head of DOGE without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause. The complaint alleges that Musk and the DOGE staff are exercising “significant authority” by controlling agency operations, making personnel decisions, and directing federal spending, all powers they claim can only be wielded by properly appointed officers of the United States. The suit asks the court to declare Musk and DOGE to be acting unlawfully, impose a temporary restraining order barring Musk and DOGE from exercising government authority (including a specific list of official actions) while awaiting preliminary and permanent injunctions to the same effect, and set aside their actions taken to date. <br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Feb. 17, the government submitted a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.24.1.pdf\">declaration</a> by Joshua Fisher, Director of the Office of Administration, stating that Musk is not the head of DOGE nor an employee of DOGE.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Feb 18, Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.29.0_1.pdf\">denied</a> the Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order but also indicated a potentially favorable view of the Plaintiffs’ argument on the merits (pp. 8-9). <br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Feb. 24, plaintiff states filed a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.45.0.pdf\">motion for expedited discovery</a> relating to an upcoming motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants filed a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.48.0.pdf\">memorandum in opposition</a> on Feb 28.

Plaintiffs’ expedited discovery motion seeks “to confirm public reporting about Defendants’ conduct, show Defendants’ future plans, and illustrate the nature and scope of the unconstitutional and unlawful authority that Defendants are exercising and will continue to imminently exercise.” The document requests and interrogatories generally concern DOGE’s and Musk’s conduct in four areas: (1) eliminating or reducing the size of federal agencies; (2) terminating or placing federal employees on leave; (3) cancelling, freezing, or pausing federal contracts, grants, or other federal funding; and (4) obtaining access, using, or making changes to federal databases or data management systems.<br/>\n<strong>Update 4:</strong> On Mar 7, defendants filed a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.58.0.pdf\">motion to dismiss</a> arguing plaintiffs lack Article III standing and have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<br/>\n<strong>Update 5:</strong> On Mar. 12, Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25559976-nmmuskdiscord031225/\">granted</a> Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery and ordered Elon Musk and DOGE to produce the requested documents and respond to the interrogatories and requests for admissions in Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. <br/>\n<strong>Update 6:</strong> On Mar. 14, Plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.64.0.pdf\">filed a memorandum</a> opposing the Defendant’s motion to dismiss, asserting that they had already suffered financial and programmatic harm and would continue to do so absent the court’s intervention.<br/>\n<strong>Update 7: </strong>On Mar. 19, Defendants <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.67.0.pdf\">filed a memorandum</a> supporting their motion to dismiss, reasserting that plaintiffs lack standing.<br/>\n<strong>Update 8:</strong> On Mar. 20, the case <em>Japanese American Citizens League v. Musk</em>, No. 25-cv-643, was consolidated with this case.<br/>\n<strong>Update 9: </strong>On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.70.0.pdf\">filed a memorandum</a> in support of their motion for expedited discovery.<br/>\n<strong>Update 10: </strong>On Mar. 26, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.41858/gov.uscourts.cadc.41858.01208724066.0_1.pdf\">stayed</a> the district court’s order for expedited discovery, holding that defendants “have shown a likelihood of success on their argument that the district court was required to decide their motion to dismiss before allowing discovery.”</br>",

The plaintiffs sued on behalf of members whose records may have been transmitted from the Treasury Department to DOGE employees, thus allegedly depriving the members of privacy. The lawsuit seeks an injunction and declaratory relief, as well as a temporary restraining order, for alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and actions in excess of legal authority under the Privacy Act.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 6, 2025, the parties in the suit mutually proposed an order that Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly adopted. It limits access to Treasury Department payment records and systems to two (Musk-affiliated) Special Government Employees in the Department (“read-only” access), other employees who need to access the record to perform their duties, or individuals who are already entitled to access the records under statute.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 20, the court issued an order accepting an unopposed motion to modify the Feb. 6 order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 25, following a hearing the previous day, the court ordered “that Defendants shall file the administrative record underlying the decisions challenged in this case on or before March 10, 2025.”\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 7, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that plaintiffs have not cleared the “high standard” of showing a likelihood of an irreparable injury that is “beyond remediation.” She noted, “If Plaintiffs could show that Defendants imminently planned to make their private information public or to share that information with individuals outside the federal government\nwith no obligation to maintain its confidentiality, the Court would not hesitate to find a likelihood of irreparable harm.” ",

A federal court temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to certain payment records maintained by the Treasury Department containing sensitive data while the case proceeds, citing potential violations of federal law.   \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs, attorneys general of 19 states, sued on the ground that the policy of giving expanded access to political appointees and “special government employees” to Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Services violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claim the policy violates the APA by exceeding authority conferred by statute for the unauthorized purpose of impeding payments and accessing private information; for failure to conduct a privacy impact statement; for violation of the Privacy Act; and for violating ethics statutes on conflicts of interest. The plaintiffs also assert the policy usurps congressional authority and is ultra virus.\nThe plaintiffs requested an emergency temporary restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunction to bar access to political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from other agencies as well as to any person who has not received a background check, security clearance, and information security training.\nUpdate 1: The case is before Judge Jeannette A. Vargas. On Feb. 8, 2025, after midnight, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued an emergency temporary restraining order until Judge Vargas holds a hearing on Feb. 14. Judge Engelmayer’s order prohibits access to the Treasury Department’s systems and also requires prohibited persons to immediately destroy any material already downloaded from the Treasury Department’s systems.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Judge Vargas granted a limited preliminary injunction, enjoining the Treasury Department from granting access to DOGE-affiliated individuals to any payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees. The court noted that “a real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law.”  The court ordered the Treasury Department to submit a report by March 24 including several forms of information and certifications including “the vetting and security clearances processes that members of the Treasury DOGE Team have undergone;” ”setting forth the legal authority pursuant to which each DOGE Team member was employed by or detailed to the Treasury Department;” and “explaining the reporting chains that govern the relationship between the DOGE Team members, USDS/DOGE, and Treasury leadership.”\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration to the court’s Feb. 21 ruling that states’ interests do not fall within personal identifying information (PII) protections of the Privacy Act of 1973 and E-Government Act of 2002.",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A coalition of labor unions sued the Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”), and others seeking to block DOGE's access to internal DOL information systems on the basis that such access violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act, the Economy Act, and other federal laws. A federal court denied requests to temporarily block DOGE’s access while the case proceeds, but indicated further analysis was needed in particular on the Economy Act claims. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 5, 2025, DOGE sought access to internal information systems at the Department of Labor. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE’s attempt to direct the agency and access internal information systems are an unlawful exercise of power beyond its authority; and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act as a prohibited personnel practice, violation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, violation of the Privacy Act, rulemaking without proper procedure, and arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion. They seek temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Department of Labor from granting access to DOGE, from taking adverse action against employees who refuse to cooperate with DOGE, and from providing any person with non-public Department of Labor information regarding that person’s business interests or direct competitors. \nOn the same day as the complaint was filed, judge John Bates issued an Order which stated, “Defendants represented to the Court that DOL [Department of Labor] will not allow DOGE access to any DOL data until after this Court rules on the TRO motion on Friday.”\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Judge Bates denied the petition for a temporary restraining order on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs submitted a renewed request for a TRO enjoining agency defendants from granting members of DOGE access to their systems of records, except as consistent with applicable federal law.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, Judge Bates denied the renewed request for a TRO, but added, “On the Economy Act question, which is the most important for this denial of a TRO, the Court will benefit from further briefing and analysis on a motion for preliminary injunction.”\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 27, Judge Bates ordered limited expedited discovery in the case in the form of answers to written interrogatories, production of documents, and the deposition of four individuals (one each from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and DOGE), to last no more than eight hours in aggregate.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 28, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition on Mar. 7.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 11, Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s prior ruling authorizing written discovery. In an accompanying memorandum, Defendants asserted that changes since the ruling, including the fact that DOGE is no longer detailing employees to any defendant agency, “should obviate the need for expedited discovery.”\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 13, Plaintiffs filed a motion opposing reconsideration of the ruling authorizing written discovery, asserting that the new employment arrangements do not “meet the exceedingly high bar” for reconsideration.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 14, Defendants filed a memorandum supporting their motion to dismiss, reasserting that plaintiffs lack standing and failed to state a claim.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 19, plaintiffs filed a notice of new evidence, notifying the court of Amy Gleason’s declaration that she is Acting Director of DOGE in Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Doge Service, 1:25-cv-00511. Plaintiffs assert that Gleason’s declaration supports their argument in favor of public access to documents surrounding Gleason’s appointment.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 19, Judge Bates issued a memorandum opinion denying Defendants’ motion for reconsideration.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 29, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel discovery, including production of documents, written discovery responses, and deposition testimony, relating to actions by members of the DOGE Teams at relevant agencies.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery, asserting that the request “is unambiguously outside the scope of” their prior requests and “does not relate to any plausible Economy Act issue.”\nUpdate 13: On Mar. 31, Judge Bates issued an order granting Plaintiffs motion to compel discovery regarding “individuals that the defendant agencies have onboarded for the purpose of carrying out the DOGE agenda,” including direct hires or detailees. The order also extends the deadline for Defendants to respond to the discovery requests.\nUpdate 14: On Apr. 16, Judge Bates issued an order dismissing counts relating to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, Administrative Procedure Act, Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \nUpdate 15: On Apr. 19, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent DOGE employees or affiliates from accessing sensitive agency systems and records.

A federal court denied the request to temporarily block DOGE’s access while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 3, 2025, reportedly 20 people affiliated with DOGE were working with the Department of Education, some of whom obtained access to sensitive internal information systems, including systems related to federal student aid. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE’s access is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act in that it is contrary to law in violation of the Privacy Act and Internal Revenue Code; arbitrary and capricious; and in excess of statutory authority. They seek a declaratory judgment that DOGE officials are not authorized to access Department of Education records that contain personal information, and temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief preventing the Department of Education from continuing to provide access to DOGE, ensuring there is no further dissemination of data, and requiring recovery of unlawfully transferred information.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, Plaintiff moved for a TRO, requesting Defendants be enjoined from disclosing information about individuals to individuals affiliated with DOGE, and required to retrieve and safeguard any such information that has already been obtained by and shared or transferred by DOGE or individuals associated with it.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 17, Judge Randolph Moss denied the TRO on the grounds that mere “access” to data by government employees who are not formally authorized to view it, without more, does not create an irreparable injury. He wrote that courts find dissemination of information to be an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information will be made public or is given to someone with no obligation to keep it confidential. He also wrote that irreparable harm was not present because plaintiffs would have a private right of action and money damages for certain unauthorized disclosures.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 4, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 18, Judge Moss denied Plaintiff’s motion for expedited discovery, instead ordering that Defendant promptly produce the relevant administrative record while noting that Plaintiff may renew their motion after the record has been received and reviewed.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 8, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that Plaintiffs lack standing and have not suffered a cognizable injury under the APA.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action.",

The plaintiffs argue that the disclosure violates federal laws under the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and goes beyond the agencies’ scope of authority. They have asked the court to declare the disclosure unlawful, stop the agencies from further sharing information, and require the agencies retrieve and destroy the information disclosed. The court has since dismissed the plaintiffs’ Privacy Act claims but is allowing the APA and action beyond the scope of agency authority claims to proceed.  \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs allege the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has given DOGE access to OPM information systems that contain sensitive personal and employment records of government employees (including Social Security numbers, demographic information, job performance information, health records, and more). Plaintiffs, current and former federal employees and unions representing them, sued, arguing OPM’s disclosure of this information to DOGE violates the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act; and that DOGE’s actions are ultra vires. They seek a declaratory judgment that the government’s actions are unlawful; temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief; and an order for the impoundment and destruction of copies of improperly disclosed personal information.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 14, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. On Feb. 19, defendants filed a memorandum in opposition. On Feb. 23, in light of a TRO issued by the District of Maryland in Am. Fed. of Teachers v. Bessent, plaintiffs joined defendants in requesting that their motion for a TRO be converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 27, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery. Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition on Mar. 4. Plaintiffs filed a reply on Mar. 6. Judge Cote granted the motion in part on Mar. 7.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, plaintiffs filed a memorandum opposing the government’s motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed their Reply Memorandum in Further Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, in which they argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing, that Plaintiffs’ complaint failed to state Privacy Act or ultra vires claims, and that Plaintiffs’ APA claims are not reviewable because they did not challenge a final agency action and Plaintiffs have another adequate legal remedy under the Privacy Act.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 3, Judge Denise Cote denied the government’s motion to dismiss in part and granted it in part with respect to some claims.  Judge Cote held that the Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims and denied the government’s motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiffs’ APA and ultra vires claims. Judge Cote granted the government’s motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiffs’ two Privacy Act claims because injunctive relief is not available as a remedy for the alleged Privacy Act violations.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 17, the Defendants filed an answer in response to the Plaintiffs’ complaint, responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the complaint and listing six defenses, including that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ claims, the complaint fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted, and that the Defendants did not act contrary to, or in violation of, any federal law.",

The unions have asked the court to declare DOGE’s access to SSA data unlawful, require DOGE return to delete the data, and stop any further sharing of information and access. The government attempted to appeal this temporary block, however their appeal was denied by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency’s access to Social Security Administration data and systems. They allege that allowing DOGE to access private citizens’ sensitive data violates several laws, including the Internal Revenue Code, the Privacy Act, the Federal Information Systems Modernization Act, the E-Government Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They further allege that Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek’s exercise of significant authority without nomination or confirmation violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The first letter clarifies that the TRO applies only to the 10 DOGE employees the government said were “assigned to SSA to further the DOGE agenda.” The second letter clarifies that other SSA employees are not subject to the TRO, and that SSA may “provide access to redacted or anonymized data or records to the DOGE Team, subject to proper training and the like,” as well as non-anonymized data “subject to certain conditions.”\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 24, Defendants filed a notice to appeal the TRO.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, the Fourth Circuit denied the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. A corrected order denying the appeal was filed on Apr. 2.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 4, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunctions and/or U.S.C. Section 705 stay, with the goal of enjoining past and future access to any SSA system of record of PII. \nUpdate 8: On Apr. 7, the defendants filed their opposition to the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and/or stay, challenging the validity of the plaintiff’s standing as well as their allegations of violations of the Privacy Act or the Internal Revenue Code, ultimately refuting plaintiff’s allegations of irreparable harm.",

Plaintiffs ask the court to declare DOGE’s access to SSA data and systems unlawful, order DOGE to disgorge or delete any unlawfully obtained data, and prohibit any further efforts by either DOGE or SSA to enable DOGE to access SSA data or systems.<br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Mar. 7, the plaintiffs filed an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.17.0.pdf\">amended complaint</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Mar. 7, the plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.21.1_1.pdf\">filed a motion</a> for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and/or stay.<br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Mar. 20, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.49.0.pdf\">granted</a> a temporary restraining <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.48.0.pdf\">order</a>.<br/>\n<strong>Update 4: </strong>On Mar. 21, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander issued two Letters to Counsel clarifying the scope of the temporary restraining order in the face of reporting that Acting SSA Commissioner Dudek claimed that the TRO required terminating all SSA employees’ access to SSA systems.

Wilcox from her position on the National Labor Relations Board.  The suit alleges the removal is in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.), which allows the president to remove Board members only in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance and only after notice and hearing. The Plaintiff is seeking relief under the Declaratory Judgement Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, to establish that she remains a rightful member of the Board and that the President lacks authority to remove her. She also seeks an injunction against the Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, who oversaw the termination.  \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, Plaintiff moved for expedited summary judgment.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, the government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing statutory restrictions protecting NLRB members unconstitutionally conflict with the President’s Article II powers.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 6, Judge Beryl Howell granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, and denied the defendant's cross motion for summary judgment. The court issued a declaratory judgment that Wilcox’s firing was unlawful and that she remains a member of the NLRB; the court further ordered that Wilcox be allowed to continue to serve in office unless removed for cause under the NLRA, and enjoined defendants from removing Wilcox or impeding her from executing her duties.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 7, defendants appealed to the D.C.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Cathy A. Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”), sued President Donald Trump for firing her from the MSPB without cause in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Harris asked the court to allow her to continue in her position while the lawsuit proceeds and to declare her removal unlawful. A federal court agreed Harris could remain in her role while the case is pending, ruling that Trump likely did not meet the standard required for her removal under applicable law. Trump appealed this ruling. A full bench of the DC Circuit had left the district court’s ruling in place while the case is being appealed. But the Supreme Court has placed a hold on the district court and DC Circuit orders pending appeal. \nCase Summary: Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris challenges her removal from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an independent federal agency.

Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”), sued President Donald Trump for firing her from the MSPB without cause in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.

Trump appealed this ruling. A full bench of the DC Circuit had left the district court’s ruling in place while the case is being appealed.

A federal judge allowed him to resume his position while the case proceeded through the courts. The Supreme Court rejected the government’s appeal of this decision on February 21.

The OSC is an independent federal agency founded by Congress as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

Dellinger is suing under six different counts and seeks a declaratory judgment that President Trump’s decision to fire him was unlawful, that the Special Counsel may only be removed for cause; and seeks an order that Dellinger may not be removed and is entitled to backpay. As precedent for the constitutionality of the statutory for-cause protection, Dellinger cites to Humphrey’s Executor.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued an administrative stay on Dellinger’s termination through midnight on February 13, 2025, while the parties submit their briefs.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 11, 2025, defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5025), making an emergency motion to stay the district court’s administrative stay. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 12, 2025, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 12, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the D.C. District Court granted a temporary restraining order, ordering that Dellinger shall continue to serve as Special Counsel and prohibiting defendants from denying him the resources and materials of his office.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 13, Defendants filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5028). In the District Court, their motion for a stay pending appeal was denied.\nUpdate 6: On Feb. 15, the D.C. Circuit rejected the Defendant’s appeal in a 2-1 opinion. \nUpdate 7: The Government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Justices to freeze and vacate the district court order that had temporarily reinstated Dellinger.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 21, the Supreme Court rejected (7-2) the Government’s petition on the ground that a TRO was not properly subject to appeal at this stage.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 26, Judge Jackson extended the TRO ordering that Dellinger remain as Special Counsel for an additional three days until she “complete[s] the written opinion on the consolidated motion for preliminary injunction and cross motions for summary judgment” (indicating she will rule on that day, Mar. 1).\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 1, Judge Jackson issued an Opinion and Order in favor of the Plaintiff.

She has asked the court to order that she cannot be removed from her role on the basis that her removal violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Inter-American Foundation Act, and the Constitution. The district court has provisionally ordered that Aviel cannot be removed from her position, however the federal officials and DOGE have appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,” which mandated the reduction of the size of the federal government and listed the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) as a covered entity. After her purported removal as President and CEO of the IAF, Plaintiff Sara Aviel filed suit against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and several federal officials, including Trump and Pete Marocco, the Acting Deputy Administrator for Policy and Planning and for Management Resources for USAID and Director of Foreign Assistance at the U.S. Department of State.

Plaintiff has requested that the Court orders that she should not be removed as President of the IAF, that Defendants may not appoint any Board members without going through the proper legal process, and declaring void any actions by Defendants purporting to act as a member of the Board of the IAF. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 26, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiff’s motion for a TRO and injunction and asserting that Plaintiff should be made to post security for costs sustained by Defendants in connection with any injunctive relief in case Defendants are later found to have been wrongfully enjoined.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 31, Plaintiff filed a reply motion supporting their motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Judge Loren Alikhan granted a preliminary injunction, stopping the removal of Aviel from her position as president and CEO of IAF, and enjoining Peter Marocco from serving as an \"acting\" Board member or anyone else without Senate confirmation.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Two unions sued the Trump administration, challenging its efforts to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”). The unions argue that the efforts are unconstitutional, violate federal law, and exceed the scope of agency authority. The unions have asked the court to declare the administration’s actions unlawful and unconstitutional, and immediately stop the administration’s efforts by appointing an independent administrator, restoring funding, and voiding the suspension of employees. The court initially stopped the administration from suspending employees but did not restore funding; however, on February 21, 2025, the court reversed its earlier temporary restrictions on the administration, on the basis that the dispute could be resolved outside of the court. On March 10, 2025, the unions filed a new motion arguing that the court should have jurisdiction to decide this dispute. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. Later, Secretary of State Rubio was named as acting USAID Administrator and USAID contractors were laid off or furloughed. On Feb. 3, Elon Musk posted that he had spent the previous weekend “feeding USAID to the woodchipper,” and USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. was closed. On Feb. 4, a message was posted on the USAID website that all directly-hired USAID staff would be placed on administrative leave as of 11:59pm EST on Friday, Feb. 7, 2025. Plaintiffs sued, arguing executive actions either to dissolve USAID or merge it with the State Department are unconstitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause; and unlawful under of the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding statutory authority, violating the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, and involving arbitrary and capricious abuses of discretion. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the administration’s actions are unlawful and unconstitutional; a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the administration to halt efforts to shut down the agency, including by appointing an independent administrator, restoring grant funding, recalling furloughs, and halting efforts to place more employees on administrative leave, among other actions. Plaintiffs also seek court supervision, and a permanent injunction barring the administration from taking action to dissolve USAID absent congressional authorization. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Judge Carl J. Nichols issued a temporary restraining order preventing USAID from placing employees on administrative leave or evacuating them. He rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a restraining order on the funding freeze on the ground that the plaintiffs (USAID employees) could not show sufficient harm to themselves. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court extended the TRO until Friday, Feb. 21, at 11:59 PM. Judge Nichols also amended the TRO’s statement to clarify that no USAID employees can be involuntarily evacuated from their host countries while the TRO remains in place.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, the Government submitted a declaration by Pete Marocco, who performs the duties and functions of both Deputy Administrators of USAID; the declaration responds to the court’s questions about government actions to protect USAID employees abroad subject to administrative leave or in the event of employees staying voluntarily beyond the time of an evacuation.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 21, Judge Nichols issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion rejecting the preliminary injunction and dissolving the TRO. His reasoning included that plaintiffs do not face irreparable harm after a series of concessions from Deputy Administrator Marocco, and that they could pursue remedies with administrative bodies governing disputes between the federal government and civil servants. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 10, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, arguing that the court (not administrative bodies) has jurisdiction over the claim, and that Defendants’ actions violate both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order alleging potential destruction of documents, including a copy of an internal email from Acting Executive Secretary of USAID Erica Carr to staff.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 12, the Defendants responded to the Mar. 11 motion for a temporary restraining order and included an affidavit by Carr. The defendants stated that the instruction to destroy documents “had nothing to do with this litigation,” was done to clear space formerly occupied by USAID, and were copies “where the originally classified document is retained by another government agency and for which there is no need for USAID to retain a copy.”\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 14, the Plaintiffs dropped their Mar. 11 motion on destruction of documents based on the Defendants’ assurances.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 7, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Defendants also filed a memorandum supporting their motion and opposing Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs failed to challenge any discrete agency action as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. They also argued that Plaintiffs’ request to overturn Defendants’ policy actions would effectively place USAID in receivership overseen by the Court, which they argue is not the role of the judiciary.",
                            "case_summary_html": "<span style=\"color: #0056a7;\"><strong>Overview:</strong></span><em> Two unions sued the Trump administration, challenging its efforts to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”). The unions argue that the efforts are unconstitutional, violate federal law, and exceed the scope of agency authority. The unions have asked the court to declare the administration’s actions unlawful and unconstitutional, and immediately stop the administration’s efforts by appointing an independent administrator, restoring funding, and voiding the suspension of employees. The court initially stopped the administration from suspending employees but did not restore funding; however, on February 21, 2025, the court reversed its earlier temporary restrictions on the administration, on the basis that the dispute could be resolved outside of the court. On March 10, 2025, the unions filed a new motion arguing that the court should have jurisdiction to decide this dispute. </em><br/><br>\n<strong>Case Summary: </strong>On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. Later, Secretary of State Rubio was named as acting USAID Administrator and USAID contractors were laid off or furloughed. On Feb. 3, Elon Musk posted that he had spent the previous weekend “feeding USAID to the woodchipper,” and USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. was closed. On Feb. 4, a message was posted on the USAID website that all directly-hired USAID staff would be placed on administrative leave as of 11:59pm EST on Friday, Feb. 7, 2025. Plaintiffs sued, arguing executive actions either to dissolve USAID or merge it with the State Department are unconstitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause; and unlawful under of the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding statutory authority, violating the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, and involving arbitrary and capricious abuses of discretion. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the administration’s actions are unlawful and unconstitutional; a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the administration to halt efforts to shut down the agency, including by appointing an independent administrator, restoring grant funding, recalling furloughs, and halting efforts to place more employees on administrative leave, among other actions. Plaintiffs also seek court supervision, and a permanent injunction barring the administration from taking action to dissolve USAID absent congressional authorization. <br/>\n<strong>Update 1: </strong>On Feb. 7, Judge Carl J.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Two nonprofit organizations sued the Trump administration over the suspension of United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”) funding. The organizations argue that the suspensions have harmed their work and employees, exceed the President’s scope of authority, and violate the Constitution. The organizations have asked the court to declare the suspension unlawful, immediately reinstate funding, and stop enforcement of the suspension. The court stopped the enforcement of a blanket suspension of funding but did not stop the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169) which affects employment and contracts. The organizations subsequently argued that the administration failed to comply with the order, to which the court ordered enforcement on the administration but did not expressly acknowledge any noncompliance. The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. On March 10, the District Court ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but it did not reject the State Department’s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. On April 1, the Trump administration appealed the District Court’s Mar. 10 decision to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants.\nPlaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN), sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the implementation of the Executive Order and the stop-work order.  Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants from USAID to support their work. Both AVAC’s and JDN’s  funding was appropriated by Congress through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. Plaintiffs allege the Executive Order and stop-work order have been detrimental to their work, forcing them to lay off staff, slashing their budgets, and impacting their ability to carry out their missions. They allege the President acted ultra vires and usurped legislative authority. They also allege the President has violated the Take Care Clause. Plaintiffs’ claims against the State Department, USAID, Secretary of State Marc Rubio, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and OMB Director Vought are that the stop-work orders are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act (as an “unlawful reserve”), and the Impoundment Control Act. Plaintiffs seek a declaration from the court that the suspension of foreign aid is unlawful, an injunction stopping defendants from enforcing the Executive Order, and an order to immediately reinstate foreign assistance funding.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining Defendants from enforcing the Executive Order and State Department policy, enjoining stop-work orders, and reinstating foreign assistance funding and administration.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and Global Health Council v. Trump on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for contempt seeking to enforce the Feb. 13 TRO against Defendants and hold them in civil contempt. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ purported compliance with the TRO “strains credulity” and that Defendants have continued to suspend funding and enforce stop-work orders in violation of the court’s orders.  \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for enforcement of the court’s TRO “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” but did not make a finding of contempt, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.” The granted motion applies to this case and Global Health Council v. Trump.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 24, plaintiffs in Global Health Council v. Trump filed an emergency renewed motion to enforce the TRO. The court held a hearing the following day and, on Feb. 25, granted the motion for a proposed order requiring the Administration pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests for work completed prior to the TRO, as well as reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The court further mandated that the Administration take no actions to impede and must ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds going forward. The court also reportedly ordered the government to provide the court, by Feb. 26 at noon, with all internal directives to agency employees concerning compliance with the TRO. \nUpdate 6: On Feb. 25, the Government submitted a notice of its decision to appeal the court’s decision to the DC Circuit, and a motion to stay the court’s order pending appeal.\nUpdate 7: On Feb. 26, the district court rejected and the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Government’s motion for a stay.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 26, the Government filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court (while the decision before the D.C. Circuit was still pending) to vacate the district court’s TRO and grant an immediate administrative stay. That evening, Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay and ordered a response by the plaintiffs by Feb. 28 at 12:p.m. EST.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 28, the Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the application.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 5, the Supreme Court rejected the Defendants’ petition in a 5-4 decision.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 6, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled from the bench that the government must make outstanding balances to the Plaintiffs by Mar. 10; but did not resolve the payments for foreign aid recipients other than the Plaintiffs, which total near $2 billion.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 10, Judge Ali granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but he did not reject the State Department’s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. He ruled that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the claim that the latter actions flowed from the original government directives in violation of the law. \nUpdate 13: On Apr. 1, Defendants appealed Judge Ali’s Mar. 10 order granting in part and denying in part the motion for a preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\n",

The group argues that these actions violated the Constitution and federal laws, and exceeded the authority of the agencies and the President. The group has asked the court to void all actions taken by the administration, and stop the administration from implementing the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169). The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. On March 10, the District Court ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but it did not reject the State Department’s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. On April 1, the Trump administration appealed the District Court’s Mar. 10 decision to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C, Circuit). \nCase Summary: A group of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that contract with USAID sued the Trump administration over its recent actions to defund USAID, lay off or furlough employees, and transfer the Agency to be under the State Department. Plaintiffs provide a detailed chronology of the actions, memoranda, and statements that the Administration has issued. In addition to imperiling future projects by freezing future funds, plaintiffs also allege that there is money unpaid for services already performed. ($3,376,832 for Democracy International, approximately $120 million for DAI, $103.6 million for Chemonics, and tens of millions for SBAIC’s members.) Plaintiffs allege that neither the President, nor the Secretary of State, nor the USAID Administrator have the authority to unilaterally withhold already-appropriated funds, citing the Constitution and statutory law prohibiting the unilateral withholding: the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act. Plaintiffs also claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the Executive’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to statutory and constitutional law. Plaintiffs ask the court to vacate and set aside all of the defendants’ actions to implement Executive Order 14169 and seek injunctions to prevent defendants from continuing to implement EO 14169 and from “dismantling USAID.”\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and State Department Memorandum.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for enforcement of the court’s TRO “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” but did not make a finding of contempt, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.” The granted motion applies to this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State. \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 24, plaintiffs filed an emergency renewed motion to enforce the TRO. The court held a hearing the following day and, on Feb. 25, granted the motion for a proposed order requiring the Administration pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests for work completed prior to the TRO, as well as reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The court further mandated that the Administration take no actions to impede and must ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds going forward. The court also reportedly ordered the government to provide the court, by Feb. 26 at noon, with all internal directives to agency employees concerning compliance with the TRO. \nUpdate 5: On Feb. 25, the Government submitted a notice of its decision to appeal the court’s decision to the DC Circuit, and a motion to stay the court’s order pending appeal.\nUpdate 6: On Feb. 26, the district court rejected and the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Government’s motion for a stay.\nUpdate 7: On Feb. 26, the Government filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court (while the decision before the D.C. Circuit was still pending) to vacate the district court’s TRO and grant an immediate administrative stay. That evening, Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay and ordered a response by the plaintiffs by Feb. 28 at 12:p.m. EST.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 28, the Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the application.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 5, the Supreme Court rejected the Defendants’ petition in a 5-4 decision.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 6, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled from the bench that the government must make outstanding balances to the Plaintiffs by Mar. 10; but did not resolve the payments for foreign aid recipients other than the Plaintiffs, which total near $2 billion.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 10, Judge Ali granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but he did not reject the State Department’s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. He ruled that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the claim that the latter actions flowed from the original government directives in violation of the law. \nUpdate 12: On Apr. 1, Defendants appealed Judge Ali’s Mar. 10 order granting in part and denying in part the motion for a preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.",

The NED asked the court to temporarily block the Executive Branch from further withholding funds while the case is pending, but this request has been put on hold as of Mar. 11 because the NED is in the process of receiving the federal funds in question. \nCase Summary: The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) filed suit challenging the Executive Branch’s withholding of funds appropriated to the Endowment by Congress. The NED was established by the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983. In the Act, Congress specified that the NED would be funded by annual congressional appropriations, which would then be disbursed to the Endowment via grants from the Department of State. The statute also prescribes that the Endowment must withdraw funds from an account held by the Department of Treasury on an as-needed basis.\nThe complaint alleges that for the past month, “the Executive Branch has denied the Endowment access to its congressionally appropriated funds—something that has never occurred before in the Endowment’s forty-two-year existence.” As a result, the Endowment claims it is “experiencing a devastating cash flow crisis that jeopardizes its ability to fulfill its mission and its very existence, as well as that of its core institutes and grantees.” The complaint alleges that the Executive Branch is obligated by the NED Act to grant the funds appropriated by Congress, and by not doing so, it is acting “contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority because the statutory scheme creates a mandatory, non-discretionary duty for Defendants to make available, obligate, and disburse the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.” The complaint argues that the administration’s actions constitute an “unlawful impoundment” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the All Writs Act, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Separation of Powers. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring Defendants from impounding the Endowment’s funds.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 6, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, parties jointly moved to stay proceedings on the TRO because the NED received part of its obligated funds requested in late Jan. and is in the process of receiving the remaining appropriated funds.

Brehm asked the court to temporarily block his own removal and Marocco’s appointment while the case proceeds and/or to block the EO in its entirety. While the federal judge agreed to block Rehm’s removal and Marocco’s appointment on an immediate and short-term basis on March 6, on March 11, that same judge did not agree to further temporarily block the actions while the case proceeds from there. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, President Trump issued Executive Order 14217, which directed that “non-statutory components and functions” of four government entities, including the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), “be eliminated,” among other actions. On Feb. 21, DOGE allegedly demanded access to USADF information systems, and USADF staff informed them of legal requirements that DOGE employees would have to satisfy before access was provided. On Feb. 24, Ward Brehm, a member of the USADF Board, allegedly received notice from the White House Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) that he had been terminated. On Feb. 28, USADF management allegedly received a letter from PPO appointing Pete Marocco as acting Chair of the Board of USADF. On Mar. 3, previously appointed members of the Board allegedly held an emergency meeting and determined that Marocco’s appointment was unlawful. On Mar. 5, Brehm allegedly informed DOGE that Marocco did not hold a position with USADF and instructed USADF staff to deny him access to its offices.\nOn Mar. 6, Brehm in his personal and official capacity, filed suit against Marocco, DOGE, and President Trump, arguing the defendants actions are (1) an ultra vires violation of the African Development Foundation Act as Marocco was neither nominated to the Board nor confirmed by the Senate; (2) an ultra vires violation of the separation of powers; (3) a violation of the APA as not in accordance with the law and in excess of statutory authority. Brehm seeks a declaratory judgment that he is the President of USADF and Marocco’s appointment was unlawful; preliminary and permanent injunctive relief; and, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus prohibiting his removal by any entity other than the Board. \nThe same day, plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 6, Judge Richard J. Leon issued an administrative stay prohibiting Brehm from being removed from office and Marocco from being appointed to the Board.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, Judge Leon issued a Memorandum Order denying the TRO request. “The heart of the problem is that Brehm has not identified any cognizable irreparable harm to himself as opposed to potential harm to the agency and its partners,” Judge Leon wrote (emphasis in original). As an aside, Judge Leon wrote that “Brehm raise[sic] a colorable Appointment Clause claim,” that the Vacancy Act does not permit the appointment of Marocco and “[t]he Court has not found–nor has the Government identified–any other statute that provides President Trump with the authority to appoint Marocco as the Acting Chairman of the Board.”\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 21, the Plaintiff submitted a motion for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, Defendants submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment alongside their opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants contend that Brehm is not entitled to the requested relief, asserting that the harm he may have experienced is neither irreparable nor warrants extraordinary relief.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a combined reply in support of their motion for summary judgment and preliminary injunction and in response to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs request that the court enter an order confirming Brehm as the lawful President of USADF and reject Defendants’ efforts to circumvent the role that the Appointments Clause provides Congress in the appointment of federal officers.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendants’ statement of material facts as to which there is no genuine dispute.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 9, Defendants filed a reply in further support of their cross motion for summary judgment, arguing that Brehm cannot succeed on the merits of his case.

A federal judge ordered the Administration to stop deleting and removing records, terminating employees without cause, or disbursing funds except for operating expenses, while the case proceeds. The government appealed this order. The Appeals Court overturned the order in part, but required the government to terminate employees only after a particularized assessment that doing so would not interfere with the CFPB’s statutory duties. \nCase Summary: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by Congress in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 great recession, to support and protect American consumers in the financial marketplace. On Feb. 7, 2025, Elon Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a tombstone emoji on his X account. On Feb. 8, Russell Vought, the Acting Director of the CFPB, posted on X that he had notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB would not take “its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties.” In an email to CFPB employees, Vought directed the CFPB workforce to “cease all supervision and examination activity,” “cease all stakeholder engagement,” pause all pending investigations, not issue any public communications, and pause “enforcement actions.” He also notified the CFPB workforce that the Washington headquarters would be closed for the coming week. Plaintiffs allege that preventing CFPB from drawing down more funding and ordering a halt on enforcement activities constitutes an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress’s decision to create CFPB, which would be a violation of the separation of powers. They seek a declaratory judgment that Vought’s directives are unlawful and an injunction that prevents him from further attempts to dismantle CFPB’s supervision and enforcement work.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Plaintiffs moved for an administrative stay and TRO enjoining defendants from taking action to terminate CFPB staff, requiring that cease work directives be lifted, and enjoining further efforts to suspend operations at CFPB.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, 2025, the court ordered that the defendants not delete, destroy, remove, or impair records; terminate any employee other than for cause or issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee; or disburse any funds, except to satisfy CFPB’s operating obligations, pending the resolution of plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO. The order also reclassified plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, the government filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiff’s motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 12, both parties filed a joint notice agreeing to extend the contract termination agreement until Mar. 28 or until the court rules on Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction, whichever comes first. The CFPB agreed to continue to freeze all termination actions regarding contracts during this period.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 28, Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 29, the government appealed Judge Jackson’s preliminary injunction order to the D.C. Circuit.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit, in a per curiam opinion, granted the stay in part. The Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction “insofar as it prohibits defendants from terminating or issuing a notice of reduction in force to employees whom defendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.”\nThe Circuit set the next oral argument for May 16, 2025. \nUpdate 8: On Apr. 17, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for an order to show cause why the Defendants have not violated the part of the court’s preliminary injunction upheld by the DC Circuit through a large-scale termination of employees earlier that day. Judge Jackson ordered a hearing for the following morning.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 18, before the hearing Plaintiffs submitted information about the terminations and Defendants submitted, per a court order, documents on the actions taken and stated reasons for them. \nAfter the hearing, Judge Jackson ordered the “the Reduction in Force announced by Acting Director Vought on or about April 17, 2025 is SUSPENDED and it may NOT be implemented, effectuated, or completed in any way until this Court has ruled on plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the preliminary injunction” (emphasis in original).",

A federal judge ordered the Administration to stop transferring or relinquishing control of reserve funds, returning any reserve funds to the Federal Reserve or the Department of Treasury, or otherwise reducing funds except for operating expenses while the case proceeds. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 7, 2025, President Trump named OMB Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On Feb. 8, Vought instructed CFPB employees to stop performing any work tasks and notified the Federal Reserve Board of Governors that he was requesting $0 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025.

They argue that the Defendants acted ultra vires and that their actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act given that they are contrary to the law and arbitrary and capricious.\nCase Summary: Since February 2025, the Defendants have allegedly taken steps to dismantle the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the research arm of the Department of Education. Actions taken include en masse cancellation of contracts for statutorily mandated work, the mass firing of nearly 90% of IES employees, and the mass termination of remote data licenses, which researchers use to access data held by IED. The Plaintiffs are an association of scholars and practitioners working on education policy and a nonprofit research organization focused on higher education research. The Plaintiffs allege they are harmed by the Defendants’ actions because their members have lost contracts and funding; because the termination of data collection and dissemination by IES will impede the Plaintiffs from undertaking research reliant on IES’s data, given that the data is not reproducible by other entities; and because the Plaintiffs and their members are unable to publish already completed research as a result of the firing of the staff that perform disclosure reviews for data used. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants’ actions are ultra vires given that IES was created by statute and can only be dismantled by the same. They also argue that the Defendants violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because their actions are contrary to law as they violate the Education Sciences Reform Act, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA. The Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief related to restoring the terminated contracts, vacating the mass firings, and vacating the decision to terminate the remote data licenses. They also seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from acting to shut down IES’s operations.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a memorandum in support of the motion, asking the Court to restrain and enjoin Defendants from terminating the functions of IES and to issue an order to reinstate active work status to IES employees whose work is necessary to perform IES’s statutory duties.",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: On Mar. 18, the United States Institute of Peace (“USIP”), an independent nonprofit corporation, and several of its Board members filed suit against several officials and entities within the federal government. The Plaintiffs argue that President Trump’s removal of the Board members without following the process mandated by the congressional statute that created and governs USIP is unlawful. They also challenge as unlawful the decision by ex officio Board members Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, and Vice Admiral Peter A. Garvin to fire USIP’s President and appoint a new President. Finally they challenge the forcible takeover of USIP’s headquarters by members of the Department of Government Efficiency. On Mar. 19, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, President Trump issued an Executive Order (“EO”) mandating the reduction of the size of the federal government. The EO named the USIP, an independent nonprofit corporation created by Congress, as one of the entities covered by the EO. Since the EO was issued, all of USIP’s Board members were fired by President Trump. Several members of Trump’s cabinet who served as ex officio Board members fired USIP’s President and appointed a new President. Members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with the help of law enforcement, physically trespassed onto USIP’s headquarters and forcibly took over the building. USIP, along with several Board members, filed suit against numerous Defendants, including President Trump, DOGE, and the ex officio Board members. The Plaintiffs argue that since Congress created USIP as an independent non-profit corporation outside of the Executive Branch, the President has no authority to take action towards USIP not permitted by the statute. They also argue that since the statute outlines the process through which Board members and the President may be removed and because that process was not followed, the removals are unlawful and without legal effect. The Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering that the Board members and President cannot be removed or be treated as having been removed unless the Defendants follow the statutorily required procedure. They also seek injunctions prohibiting trespass against USIP’s real and personal property and prohibiting Defendants from exercising any access or control over USIP’s offices, computer systems, or records. Finally, the Plaintiffs request that the Court declare that the Board Member Plaintiffs remain members of the Board, the President remains in his position, and the President appointed by the ex officio Board members has not been lawfully appointed to any position in USIP. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”), asserting that the president’s authority in the firings is unrestricted and non-justiciable, and that Plaintiffs lack standing and have not suffered irreparable harm.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 19, the Court denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO. The Court said the Plaintiffs did not make a sufficient showing of a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reflecting additional plaintiffs and details regarding the administration’s ongoing efforts to dismantle the USIP. The amended complaint additionally alleges that Defendants’ actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to rescind terminations of USIP leadership taken since initiation of the lawsuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion under the All Writs Act for a status conference on the case and requesting that the court suspend efforts taken by Defendants to transfer USIP property to the General Services Administration until the court can resolve the issue.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiffs’ motion under the All Writs Act, asserting that Plaintiffs have no legal authority to sue and have not shown the requisite likelihood of irreparable harm and that Defendants’ actions were lawful.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum supporting their motion under the All Writs Act, reasserting that the president does not have at-will removal authority over the USIP’s board of directors.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 1, Judge Beryl Howell issued a minute order denying the All Writs Act motion in part as moot and in part on the merits.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and an accompanying statement of material facts, asserting that the facts of the case as stipulated by both parties establish that the president does not have authority to fire members of the USIP’s board at will.

Judge James Bredar ordered the restoration of the employment of the probationary workers whose sudden layoffs harmed Plaintiff States and ordered Defendants to not conduct future RIFs except in compliance with law, but the appeals court blocked his order while the case is on appeal. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order instructing agency heads to “undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs).” \nPlaintiff States allege that Defendant agencies violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not abiding by the necessary statutory and regulatory requirements for RIF procedures including a required 60-day notice to states and employees; and on ground that the procedures adopted were arbitrary and capricious. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the Defendant agencies to 1) cease the RIFs of probationary employees; 2) reinstate any employees who were fired as part of the mass terminations that followed President Trump’s second inauguration; 3) refrain from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated employees; and 4) conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable law, including providing advance notice to States.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 13, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A group of labor and nonprofit organizations are challenging the Office of Personnel Management’s (“OPM”) order to terminate federal employees en masse. The organizations argue that the terminations have falsely cited performance reasons and violate the Constitution and federal law. The organizations also argue that the OPM has violated federal law by sending emails to employees requesting weekly updates on their work; Elon Musk further stated that failure to comply would be considered a resignation. The organizations have asked the court to declare the mass termination unlawful, void the mass termination order, and rescind unlawful terminations made so far. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the mass termination order and ordered the firings to be stopped and rescinded. The government has appealed for the Supreme Court to remove that temporary block.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 13, 2025, the Office of Personnel Management and Acting Director Charles Ezell ordered federal agencies to terminate tens of thousands of probationary employees en masse. Probationary employees are members of the competitive service in their first year of employment or of the excepted service in their first two years of employment, and may also include long-time federal workers who have recently been employed in a new position or a new agency.\nAmong the factual claims, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants sent agencies “standardized notices of termination, drafted by OPM, that falsely state that the terminations are for performance reasons.” Plaintiffs allege that the mass termination violates multiple requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act and separation of powers principles by overriding Congressional statutes authorizing and regulating agency hiring and firing. They seek a declaration that the mass termination is unlawful and a preliminary or permanent injunction setting aside OPM’s order, ceasing terminations pursuant to the order, and rescinding any prior unlawful terminations.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 23, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that OPM further violated the APA by sending emails to government employees requesting updates on their week-to-week accomplishments and Musk’s stating that “[f]ailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 27, Judge William Alsup reportedly ruled from the bench that OPM had no legal authority to issue directives for other  agencies to fire probationary employees. Alsup noted that, due to jurisdictional issues, his order applies only to employees at six agencies (the National Park Service, National Science Foundation, Small Business Administration, Bureau of Land Management, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense), and that he could not directly order agencies to cease  the firings. As for other agencies not covered, Alsup said, “I am going to count on the government to do the right thing, and to go a little bit further than I have ordered, and to let some of these agencies know what I have ruled.”\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 28, Judge Alsup issued an Opinion and a written Order for a TRO. The Order states that OPM’s memos directing the termination of probationary workers were “unlawful, invalid, and must be stopped and rescinded,” and that OPM must provide written notice of the order to the six agencies.  \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 13, Judge Alsup held a preliminary injunction hearing and, in ruling from the bench, granted and extended the TRO. Alsup directed counsel to file briefs by Mar. 21. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 13, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 17, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s request for an administrative stay.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 24, the government filed an application requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court immediately stay the Northern District of California’s preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 24, Judge Alsup issued two orders on the case. In one order, Alsup concluded that the district court does have subject-matter jurisdiction in the case, and therefore reversed the part of his earlier TRO ruling denying relief to plaintiffs. In the second, he ordered the government to show cause that relief should not be extended to plaintiffs by Mar. 28.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 26, the Ninth Circuit denied Defendants’ emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel compliance with the preliminary injunction or hold Defendants in contempt, arguing that Defendants have failed to reinstate terminated employees and notify them of the unlawful terminations as ordered by the court on Feb. 27. \nUpdate 11: On Mar. 27, one Plaintiff – the State of Washington – filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the court extend prior relief awarded to the class of Plaintiffs to itself, require Defendants to reinstate terminated probationary employees, and order Defendants to cease unlawful terminations.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay on the basis of standing. The Court wrote: “The District Court’s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations’ standing. This order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs, which did not form the basis of the District Court’s preliminary injunction.”",

In one order, Alsup <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.153.0_2.pdf\">concluded</a> that the district court does have subject-matter jurisdiction in the case, and therefore reversed the part of his earlier TRO ruling denying relief to plaintiffs. In the second, he <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.154.0_1.pdf\">ordered</a> the government to show cause that relief should not be extended to plaintiffs by Mar. 28.<br/>\n<strong>Update 9</strong>: On Mar. 26, the Ninth Circuit <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.51fc2b15-8193-40ab-9ac0-c06b8c86c68c/gov.uscourts.ca9.51fc2b15-8193-40ab-9ac0-c06b8c86c68c.27.0.pdf\">denied</a> Defendants’ emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction.<br/>\n<strong>Update 10: </strong>On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69655364/155/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-v-united-states/\">filed</a> a motion to compel compliance with the preliminary injunction or hold Defendants in contempt, arguing that Defendants have failed to reinstate terminated employees and notify them of the unlawful terminations as ordered by the court on Feb. 27. <br/>\n<strong>Update 11: </strong>On Mar. 27, one Plaintiff – the State of Washington – <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.444883/gov.uscourts.cand.444883.156.0.pdf\">filed</a> a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the court extend prior relief awarded to the class of Plaintiffs to itself, require Defendants to reinstate terminated probationary employees, and order Defendants to cease unlawful terminations.<br/>\n<strong>Update 12</strong>: On Apr. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25888808/24a904-order.pdf\">granted a stay</a> on the basis of standing. The Court wrote: “The District Court’s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations’ standing. This order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs, which did not form the basis of the District Court’s preliminary injunction.”</br>",

The committees argue that the EO violates the Federal Election Campaign Act and ask the court to block the EO from being enforced.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 18, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order asserting that the Constitution vests all executive authority in the President, arguing that independent regulatory agencies exercise executive functions, and declaring the administration’s policy that such agencies fall under the supervision and control of the President. Such supervision and control requires independent agencies to abide by the President and Attorney General’s interpretations of the law. Plaintiffs, three national committees of the Democratic Party, filed suit as to how the order applies to the Federal Election Commission, an independent regulatory agency. They ask the court under the judicial review provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to construe as constitutional the provisions of the Act that vest members of the Commission with authority to interpret it (rather than the President); and they argue the order violates the FECA. They seek declaratory judgment that the FECA is constitutional and that the executive order is unlawful as applied to the FEC; and they seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a memorandum reasserting that the EO violates FECA and that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 14, Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, in their capacities as defendants, filed a motion to dismiss. In an accompanying memorandum, they assert that plaintiffs lack standing to sue and failed to properly state a claim and that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 21, the FEC and its individual commissioners, in their capacities as defendants, filed a motion to dismiss. In an accompanying memorandum, they assert various deficiencies in plaintiffs’ suit, including failure to state a claim and lack of standing, ripeness, and subject-matter jurisdiction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 25, Trump and Bondi, in their capacities as defendants, filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs’ motion for a PI, asserting that plaintiffs’ claim lacks standing and ripeness and that plaintiffs have failed to establish imminent irreparable harm.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 25, the FEC and its individual commissioners, in their capacities as defendants, filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs’ motion for a PI, asserting that plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are speculative and therefore neither imminent nor irreparable.\nUpdate 6: On April 1, plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for PI reiterating their position that the EO violates FECA and is causing irreparable harm.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 2, plaintiffs filed a consolidated memorandum in opposition to both President Trump’s and Attorney General Bondi’s and the FEC’s motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficient standing to bring suit, and that they properly stated claims.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 7, defendants Donald Trump and Pamela Bondi filed a reply memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss, reiterating their allegations that the plaintiffs’ claims lack standing and alleging failure to state a claim for relief.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 7, the FEC filed a reply to the plaintiffs’ response to the FEC’s motion to dismiss, reiterating their allegations that the plaintiffs’ claims lack standing.",

These organizations and individuals allege violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Constitution, and Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court has ordered SAA and DOGE to temporarily revoke their actions and cease from making additional workforce changes until they can ensure such changes will not impact Plaintiffs’ access to services.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order No. 14158 establishing the Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE), which is allegedly led by Elon Musk. Under the direction of Defendants Musk and DOGE, the Social Security Administration (SAA) has eliminated two offices that enable it to meet the needs of beneficiaries with disabilities: the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO) and the Office of Transformation. SAA’s workforce has also been significantly reduced, which is impacting its ability to provide its beneficiaries of essential services, and SSA has eliminated the ability of many beneficiaries to use the telephone to, among other things, file benefit claims. Plaintiffs are disability rights organizations and individuals with disabilities, including older adults, who depend on Social Security benefits to meet their most basic and essential needs. They are suing the SAA, DOGE, and the leaders of these two organizations for their roles in dismantling and reducing the SAA workforce. Plaintiffs allege the government’s actions constitute violations of Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Fifth Amendment procedural due process, the First Amendment right to petition the government, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (specifically, claiming that these actions are arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, not in accordance with law, and unlawfully withheld). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the restrictions on access to SSA benefits and ensure SAA is compelled to fulfill its statutory duties following the dismantling of its workforce. \nUpdate 1: Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that the Court order SAA and DOGE to revoke their actions and prevent these agencies from making additional workforce changes until they can ensure such changes will not impact Plaintiffs’ access to services.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 3, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction without issuing a full opinion due to the expedited nature of the matter.",

The plaintiffs argue that OMB’s memo violates the Constitution and federal law, and exceeds the scope of its authority. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the memo unlawful and unconstitutional, and stop the OMB from implementing or enforcing its memo. After the court temporarily stopped OMB from implementing the memo, OMB rescinded its memo but issued a statement that the underlying EOs on freezing federal funding was still in effect and would be implemented. The court subsequently issued a temporary block on OMB from implementing the funding freeze. On February 11, the plaintiffs requested the block be extended for the duration of the lawsuit and on February 25, the court granted the plaintiffs’ request.\nCase Summary: The Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum purported to “require every federal agency to temporarily pause” any agency activities “that may be implicated by [President Trump’s] executive orders.” The plaintiff organizations, represented by Democracy Forward, are small businesses and nonprofits that receive federal funds. The suit sought a temporary restraining order to allow the Court “an opportunity to more fully consider the illegality of OMB’s actions,” alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 28, 2025, Judge Loren AliKhan of the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order against the OMB policy to allow arguments from the plaintiffs and the government.\nUpdate 2: On Jan. 29, 2025, the Government submitted a Notice that the OMB had rescinded the challenged memo. On the same day, the White House Press Secretary stated, “This is not a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 3, 2025, Judge Alikhan issued a temporary restraining order blocking the OMB from implementing its funding freeze, finding that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the directive was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and that the post-complaint rescission of the memorandum was “disingenuous”  and still causing irreparable injury. The order directed the OMB to release the frozen funds, notify agencies of this TRO, and file a status report on compliance by Feb. 7, 2025.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Trump Administration from reinstating the funding freeze. The Government filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion, and plaintiffs replied. The hearing was held on Feb. 20.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 25, the court issued a memorandum opinion and granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Trump administration from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the blanket freeze on disbursement of Federal funds. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 14, the Defendants filed an answer to the Plaintiffs’ complaint, responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the Plaintiffs’ allegations and claiming that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims, the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and the relief that Plaintiffs seek is barred by sovereign immunity and not available under the APA.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: The attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), challenging its directive to pause federal funding as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment. While the OMB later rescinded the memo referred to in the states’ complaint, the federal courts since then have ruled that the Trump Administration should release the funding freeze and the First Circuit of Appeals issued a voluntary dismissal of the Trump Administration’s appeal of the Rhode Island District Court’s ruling.\nCase Summary: The Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum purported to “require every federal agency to temporarily pause” any agency activities “that may be implicated by [President Trump’s] executive orders.” The attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against enforcement of the policy. The suit alleges that the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 28, responding to National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management and Budget, Judge Loren AliKhan of the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order against the OMB policy to allow arguments from the plaintiffs and the government.\nUpdate 2: On Jan. 29, the Government submitted a Notice that the OMB had rescinded the challenged memo. On the same day, the White House Press Secretary stated, “This is not a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”\nUpdate 3: On January 31, Judge McConnell issued a temporary restraining order against the OMB policy to allow the states to file their motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge McConnell’s order notes that the case is not moot because “the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts.” The judge also wrote, \"the States are likely to succeed on the merits of some, if not all, their claims.\" \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 10, Judge McConnell granted Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the temporary restraining order. Judge McConnell noted the Plaintiff States presented evidence suggesting that Defendants “have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds” (citing three exhibits). Judge McConnell emphasized that this is a violation of the TRO and ordered Defendants to immediately restore frozen funding.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 14, the First Circuit issued a voluntary dismissal of defendants’ motion to appeal the decision. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 6, Judge McConnell granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants were enjoined from in any way impeding the disbursement of appropriated federal funds to the states.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 10, the defendants filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 24, the plaintiffs filed a renewed second motion to enforce the Court’s preliminary injunction order entered on Mar. 6 as it pertains to the freezing of FEMA funds, claiming that the plaintiff states have continued to experience significant obstacles to accessing federal funds despite the Court’s order.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 26, the First Circuit denied defendants’ motion for a stay pending the appeal of the district court’s preliminary injunction order. The First Circuit noted defendants did not meet their burden of proof in their motion.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 27, defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs' renewed second motion to enforce the Court’s preliminary injunction order on Mar. 6 as it pertains to the freezing of FEMA funds. Defendants argue the manual review process delaying the payment of FEMA funds is not equivalent to a pause or freeze of funds and is accordingly compliant with the district court’s preliminary injunction order.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 31, plaintiffs filed their reply in support of renewed second motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, offering new facts regarding FEMA’s manual review of grant programs and requesting that FEMA be ordered to halt its funding freeze.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 4, Judge McConnell held that the government was not in compliance with the preliminary injunction. “FEMA's manual review process violates the Court's preliminary injunction order,” the court wrote with instructions to cease the manual review process.",

The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, seeking to restore the suspended funding.\nCase Summary: The Plaintiffs—Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and four Pennsylvania governmental departments—allege that five Executive Orders and a subsequent OMB Directive froze funds already appropriated to various departments and projects in Pennsylvania.

On Mar. 17, a federal judge denied the nonprofit’s request for a temporary block while the case proceeds.</em><br/><br>\n<strong>Case Summary:</strong> On Feb. 19, 2025, FEMA placed a hold on grant funds that are due and owed under a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA to the Plaintiff relating to the Next Generation Warning System (NGWS) for the nation’s emergency alert system. FEMA has not identified any reason for this hold. Plaintiff claims that FEMA’s failure to allow CPB to submit reimbursements and receive payments owed to 42 sub-awardee public media stations, which have committed funds to purchase critical equipment for NGWS program upgrades and enhancements, is arbitrary and unlawful. Plaintiffs bring the suit under the Administrative Procedure Act arguing the government conduct is arbitrary and capricious, and they seek a TRO and preliminary injunction. <br/>\n<strong>Update 1: </strong>Plaintiff filed a motion for a TRO on Mar. 13, 2025. Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the TRO on Mar. 15, and Plaintiff filed a reply on Mar. 16. <br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Mar. 17, 2025, Judge Timothy Kelly denied Plaintiff’s motion for a TRO. </br>",

The EPA ordered Citibank to freeze the funds, and Citibank is now withholding the funds, effectively terminating Climate United Fund’s grant. A federal judge has temporarily granted a limited block preventing the EPA and Citibank from implementing the grant termination and transferring the funds elsewhere.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff Climate United Fund has brought suit against the EPA and Citibank for the withholding of its grant funding obtained from the EPA in 2024 through the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). The grant requires Climate United’s grant funds to be held at Citibank under a Financial Agent Agreement (FAA) between Citibank and the U.S. Treasury Department, and an Account Control Agreement (ACA) between Citibank, Climate \nUnited, and EPA that sets forth the specific details for EPA to exercise “control” as a secured party. On Feb. 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made a public statement announcing EPA’s goal of taking back grant funds disbursed to Climate United Fund and other recipients pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA and Zeldin then started to take multiple actions designed to suspend or terminate Climate United’s grant. Citibank is now refusing to honor Climate United’s disbursement requests despite contractual obligation to do so, citing the need for further direction from the EPA before disbursing any grant funds. Climate United Fund has been forced to defer compensation for some employees and will shortly run out of funds to pay operating expenses. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to order Citibank to disburse funds, enjoin the EPA and Zeldin from impeding Citibank from disbursing funds, and enjoin the EPA and Zeldin from unlawfully suspending or terminating Climate United’s grant award. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 10, Plaintiff filed a motion requesting a temporary restraining order (“TRO”). On Mar. 12, both Citibank and the EPA filed motions in opposition to the TRO. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, the EPA terminated Climate United Fund’s grant. On Mar. 17, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint to include the unlawful termination of the grant. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, Judge Tanya Chutkan granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff’s motion for a TRO, enjoining the EPA and Citibank from implementing the grant termination and transferring the funds elsewhere. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction to request that the Court prevent the Federal Defendants from (1) effectuating the EPA’s Mar. 11 termination of Climate United Fund’s grant, (2) unlawfully limiting access to the funds related to Plaintiffs’ grants, and (3) impeding Citibanks’ access to funds related to the grants.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 26, the Federal Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’ consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 28, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of Plaintiffs’ consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 31, the Federal Defendants filed an opposition to the Subgrantee Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\nOn that same day,  Judge Chutkan ordered the extension of the TRO.

The plaintiffs allege that these delays and terminations are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act and seek injunctive relief to compel review of applications and to block the NIH from terminating previously approved grants.\nCase Summary: Following President Trump’s issuance of Executive Orders 14151, 14168 and 14173, which directed that federal funds should not be used to promote “gender ideology” or DEI, federal agencies issued policy directives implementing the executive orders at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nOn Apr. 4, 2025 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the attorneys general of 15 additional states sued the NIH and various institutes and centers administered by the NIH, as well as NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for failure to properly review or administer NIH grants and grant renewals.\nPlaintiffs allege that since January, all upcoming meetings for NIH grant applications by the two NIH bodies who review grants (a group of subject matter experts and an advisory council that considers funding availability and agency priorities) have been cancelled and that scheduling of future meetings has been delayed and minimized. In addition, they claim that the NIH has indefinitely withheld issuing final decisions on applications that have already received approval from these review bodies, including grant renewals, and that the NIH has terminated large numbers of already-issued grants for projects deemed to be connected to certain topics, including DEI, transgender issues, and vaccine hesitancy, in response to Executive Orders 14151, 14168 and 14173. These grants were terminated on the basis that they “no longer effectuate[] agency priorities”. \nPlaintiffs argue that the actions by the NIH violate the APA as they are both contrary to NIH regulations and statutes and “arbitrary and capricious”, and that they also violate the Separation of Powers and Spending Clauses of the Constitution. They allege that these delays and terminations have caused significant harm to public research institutions within their states and are seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction compelling the defendants to review delayed applications and barring them from carrying out terminations of grants.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction (along with a memorandum of law)  seeking to block Defendants from implementing policy directives issued pursuant to the EOs at issue.",

The DOE also announced that it will terminate all university grant awards that do not conform with the new policy. Plaintiffs, including associations representing universities and colleges and individual universities, sued on Apr. 14, alleging that the reduction in indirect cost rate to 15% will have immediate destructive effects on DOE-funded research.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Multiple nonprofits sued multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others, to challenge an Executive Order requiring a pause of funding appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The lawsuit argues that the wholesale freeze of funding violates federal law, and the nonprofits ask the court to bar the agencies from continuing to pause funding and to disburse funding that was previously frozen. \nCase Summary: President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14154 mandates that all agencies immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that pertain to policies outlined in Section 2 of the EO, which relate to climate change, infrastructure improvement, and public health protection. The EO requires agencies to seek the approval of both the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, who must review and ensure disbursements are consistent with EO’s policies, prior to disbursing funds. OMB issued a memo to that effect. \nThe six Plaintiffs are three nonprofits with environmental and conservation missions, one conservation district, one nonprofit community development corporation, and a network of nonprofit organizations.

The lawsuit argues that the wholesale freeze of funding violates federal law, and the nonprofits ask the court to bar the agencies from continuing to pause funding and to disburse funding that was previously frozen. </em><br/><br>\n<strong>Case Summary:</strong> President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14154 mandates that all agencies immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that pertain to policies outlined in Section 2 of the EO, which relate to climate change, infrastructure improvement, and public health protection. The EO requires agencies to seek the approval of both the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, who must review and ensure disbursements are consistent with EO’s policies, prior to disbursing funds. OMB issued a memo to that effect. <br/>\nThe six Plaintiffs are three nonprofits with environmental and conservation missions, one conservation district, one nonprofit community development corporation, and a network of nonprofit organizations. They are suing the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and their respective Secretaries. They are also suing the Environmental Protection Agency and its Administrator, the Office of Management and Budget and its Director, and the Director of the National Economic Council. <br/>\nFollowing the Executive Order and the OMB memo, the named federal agencies paused all funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA.

On Apr. 1, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Recent Developments, opposing any shortening of briefing deadlines or hearing timelines. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 2, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery.

Voice of America (VOA) is a media outlet under USAGM. The current director of VOA and three VOA journalists brought a suit against USAGM to permanently or at least temporarily block the dismantling of VOA and restore the jobs of all employees placed on administrative leave so that VOA’s broadcasting activities can resume. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order that eliminated non-mandatory functions and sections of seven federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), and required them to reduce mandatory functions and personnel to the legal minimum. Voice of America (VOA) is a government-funded media outlet under the USAGM. Michael Abramowitz, the current director of VOA, and three VOA journalists, including two whose visas depend on their employment with VOA, sued Kari Lake (Senior Advisor to the Acting CEO of USAGM), Victor Morales (Acting CEO of USAGM), and USAGM alleging that the dismantling of USAGM was unlawful. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the defendants’ conduct violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the separation of powers clause of the Constitution, the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, and exceeds their statutory and constitutional authority. Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction to permanently or at least temporarily enjoin defendants from terminating VOA employees and dismantling VOA and to restore the jobs of all employees placed on administrative leave so that VOA’s broadcasting activities can resume.\nUpdate 1: On March 28, Defendants filed their opposition to plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief, opposing plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs have not met the burden required to justify a TRO or preliminary injunction, and that the court should require Plaintiffs to post a bond commensurate with the scope of any temporary order (which Defendants suggested should be in excess of $15 million in this case).\nUpdate 2: On April 1, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s proposed schedule and motion to stay proceedings. Defendants moved to stay all proceedings pending the outcome of plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction in Widakuswara v. Lake, Civ. A. No. 25-2390 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2025), where a temporary restraining order was filed on March 28, 2025. Defendants argued that the relief sought in Widakuswara “largely provides the relief sought in this action.” In the alternative, Defendants requested the court provide three weeks for Defendants to file their opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 2, the Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to the Defendants’ motion to stay proceedings and proposed schedule, along with a declaration from VOA director Michael Abramowitz. The Plaintiffs claim that their case concerns different plaintiffs and causes of action than Widakuswara, and that the Defendants have not satisfied their high burden for a stay.",

The USDA froze the funds on April 2 on the basis that by permitting transgender girls and women to participate in girls’ and women’s school sports, Maine is allegedly in violation of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act and is not in compliance with two Executive Orders by President Trump. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 14168, stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. On Feb. 5, the administration issued Executive Order 14201, directing the federal government to interpret and enforce Title IX under the sex definitions provided in Executive Order 14168, which would bar transgender women and girls from competing in women’s sports.\nOn April 2, Maine received a letter from Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, stating that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was freezing funds for certain technological functions in schools in Maine, as well as reviewing all research and education-related grants and  funding. The letter stated that in order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from USDA, Maine must demonstrate compliance with “Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against males.” Despite commitments from Secretary Rollins that this freeze would not affect funding to feed schoolchildren, on April 3, Maine’s Child Nutrition Program was allegedly unable to access various federal funds. \nPlaintiff alleges that the funding freeze is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, they argue that the freeze is  “arbitrary and capricious” and taken without observance of procedure required by law, as Secretary Rollins allegedly did not follow numerous required procedures, including notification, investigation, and related hearings. Plaintiff has requested the court vacate the funding freeze and issue a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the USDA from impeding Maine’s access to federal funds based on the alleged violation of Title IX without following all legally required procedures.",

She argues that the EO violates her constitutional rights and federal law, and exceeds BOP’s scope of authority. She has asked the court to stop the EO’s implementation. The court granted her request and has temporarily stopped the EO, requiring prison officials to maintain her medical care and to not transfer her. The case has since been transferred to the court local to where the woman is currently in custody.\nCase Summary: Trump’s Executive Order mandates that federal inmates be housed according to sex defined as “immutable biological classification,” regardless of gender identity, and directs the Bureau of Prisons not to expend federal funds on gender-affirming care. The plaintiff, Maria Moe, is a transgender female federal inmate who was placed in a Special Housing Unit to await transfer to a men’s facility. The suit seeks to enjoin the Executive Order on the basis that it violates the 5th Amendment by discriminating against transgender individuals on the basis of sex and gender identity; the 8th Amendment by subjecting Moe to risk to life and dignity; the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate Moe’s gender dysphoria; and the Administrative Procedure Act by doing so in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 26, the judge reportedly issued a temporary restraining order requiring prison officials to maintain Moe's medical care and not to transfer her from the general population of the women's facility.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 7, the judge issued an order transferring the case “to the United States District Court for the district in which [Moe] is currently confined” and terminating proceedings in the District of Massachusetts.

She brings claims alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment, Eighth Amendment, Rehabilitation Act, and Administrative Procedure Act, and she seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the EO.<br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> Feb. 21, Plaintiff filed a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69628010/21/jones-v-trump/\">motion</a> for a TRO and preliminary injunction on an emergency basis to stop Defendants from enforcing two sections of Executive Order 14168: Section 4(a), which requires inmate segregation based on biological sex, and Section 4(c), which bars federal prisons from providing medical care that would align inmates' physical characteristics with their gender identity. <br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Feb. 24, the court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335.28.0.pdf\">granted</a> plaintiff's motion for a TRO and Preliminary Injunction, stopping the Administration from enforcing Sections 4(a) and 4(c) of Executive Order 14168 and maintaining Plaintiff’s housing and medical treatment.<br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Feb. 28, four additional Plaintiffs were added through an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335.35.0.pdf\">Amended Complaint</a>, and they submitted a <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jones-v-Trump-tro-and-preliminary-injunction-request-feb-28-2025.pdf\">motion</a> for a TRO and preliminary injunction.<br/>\n<strong>Update 4:</strong> On Mar. 3, the court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335.46.0.pdf\">granted</a> Plaintiffs’ motion to extend the TRO and preliminary injunction to the new plaintiffs added by the amended complaint. <br/>\n<strong>Update 5: </strong>On Apr. 2, Defendants <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335/gov.uscourts.dcd.277335.61.0.pdf\">appealed</a> the Feb. 28 and Mar. 3 orders granting the emergency applications for a TRO and preliminary injunction.</br>",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A group of transgender service members and prospective enlistees challenged the Trump administration’s executive orders (“EOs”) banning transgender individuals from enlisting and serving in the military. They argue that the ban is unconstitutional and has asked the court to stop implementation of the EO. The court has ordered that the government notify both the court and the plaintiffs of policies or guidance for implementing the EO, at which point the court will consider the plaintiffs’ request. In response, the government submitted to the court a memo on implementing the EO, to which the plaintiffs have renewed their request. On Mar. 18, the court preliminarily blocked the military ban. \nCase Summary: On January 27, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. The order rescinds prior policy allowing transgender individuals to serve openly if they meet military standards. This order categorically prohibits both enlistment and continued service, deeming transgender individuals incompatible with military standards of “troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.” The plaintiffs are a group of active duty transgender service members and prospective or current enlistees. They argue that the categorical exclusion of this class of individuals from military service violates equal protection under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause because the policy is arbitrary and lacks a legitimate government interest.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 3, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 4, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb, 5, the court ordered the Government to notify plaintiffs and the court of any Department of Defense policy or guidance implementing the Executive Order. If any such action is taken, the court will entertain Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO.\nUpdate 4: In response to the Court’s order to update any policies or guidance implementing Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Extremism…”) or Executive Order 14183 (“Prioritizing Miliary…”), the government filed a memorandum for Senior Pentagon Leadership Commanders of the Combatant Commands Defense Agency and DoD Field Activity Directors, released on February 26, 2025, Subject: Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness. The Memorandum requires updating of military guidance as it relates to transgender service members and provides a new policy, “Service Members and Applicants for Military Service who Have a Current Diagnosis or History of, or Exhibit Symptoms Consistent with, Gender Dysphoria.” The new policy states that “Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,” and orders that “steps to identify Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria within 30 days of this memorandum.” It also states that “history of cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria or in pursuit of a sex transition, is disqualifying,” including already-extended offers of admission to military academies, and applies restrictions on individuals post-separation benefits eligibility. \nWhile waivers are available, the applicant “must be willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with the applicant's sex.”\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 18, Judge Ana Reyes granted Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction, extending to all transgender service members facing the same irreparable harm. The Court stays its Order until Mar. 21, 2025, to provide Defendants time to consider filing an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include additional plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Jamie Hash, Vera Wolf, Hunter Marquez, Ashley Davis, and Samuel Ahearn also filed a motion requesting a TRO to block enforcement of the EO and Department of Defense memoranda and preserve the status quo, on the basis that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim and likely to face irreparable harm. The motion states: “In light of this Court’s March 18, 2025, order granting a nationwide preliminary injunction of the Military Ban, ECF No. 88, which the Court administratively stayed pending Defendants’ Motions, see Minute Order (Mar. 21, 2025), this Court should temporarily restrain enforcement of the Military Ban with respect to these specific adverse actions toward Moving Plaintiffs until it resolves Defendants’ Motions on the merits.”\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 26, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit appealing Judge Reyes’ Mar. 18 order renewing the preliminary injunction.  ",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Two nonprofit organizations representing LGBTQ interests and their members sued the Trump administration, challenging an executive order (“EO”) which restricts gender-affirming care for individuals under 19, ended government-provided medical insurance coverage for gender-affirming care, and stops federal funding to institutions which promote \"gender ideology.\" The plaintiffs argue that the EO exceeds the President’s authority and violates multiple constitutional rights including the right to free speech. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the EO unconstitutional and unlawful, and stop the implementation of the EO. On March 4, a federal judge preliminarily blocked enforcement of the EO while the case proceeds. The Trump administration appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Mar. 21. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs asserted that the government had acted in violation of the judge’s order blocking the enforcement of the EO by sending notices which allegedly renewed previous threats to withhold federal funds. The judge disagreed, explaining the current structure of the notices merely advises the agencies that the funding of grants may change in the future.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order prohibiting the federal government from expending federal funds to promote “gender ideology,” the idea that gender identity can differ from biological sex. On January 28, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the federal government to bar medical institutes that receive research and education grants, including medical schools and hospitals, from administering gender affirming care to individuals under the age of 19. The order also ended coverage for gender affirming care in government-provided medical benefits, and ordered the Office of Management and Budget to instruct private health insurers that government employee plans were barred from covering such care. Finally, the order directs the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement against female genital mutilation and develop legislation for a private right of action against medical professionals performing gender-affirming procedures, pursuant to an older statute against female genital mutilation. PFLAG and other plaintiffs filed suit, arguing the orders constitute unconstitutional presidential action in excess of Article II authority; discriminate on the basis of sex and disability in violation of statutes; violate the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection and substantive due process guarantees; and abridge the First Amendment’s free speech clause. Plaintiffs seek to have the orders declared unconstitutional and unlawful, and asking for temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 5, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb 13, Judge Brendan Abell Hurson issued a two-week TRO, blocking enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 26, Plaintiffs moved to extend the TRO. Judge Hurson extended the TRO until March 5, 2025.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 4, Judge Brendan Hurson granted Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Defendants from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under age 19. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for enforcement of the preliminary injunction, asserting that the government violated the injunction by issuing notices renewing threats to withhold federal funds from organizations providing gender-affirming care.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 10, the government filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs’ emergency motion, asserting that the government’s actions “do not violate this Court’s preliminary injunction” because they do not directly “condition, withhold, or terminate” aid under the enjoined provisions. In response, plaintiffs filed a memorandum asserting that the government’s notices “are overt threats by Defendants that federal funding recipients risk losing their federal funding if they provide gender affirming medical care to a patient under the age of nineteen.”\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 21, the government filed notice that it was appealing the Mar. 4 preliminary injunction in the case to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 28, the District Court denied plaintiffs’ emergency motion for enforcement of the preliminary injunction. The Court explained that the government’s notices presently do not violate the preliminary injunction order because they merely advise the agencies that grant funding could change in the future.",

The plaintiffs argue that the EO violates the Constitution, federal law, and states’ powers. The plaintiffs have asked the court to immediately block implementation of the EO. The court granted their request and blocked the EO, but has permitted the Attorney General to prosecute medical professionals who perform gender-affirming procedures, as “female genital mutilation.” \nCase Summary: On Jan. 28, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the federal government to bar medical institutes that receive research and education grants, including medical schools and hospitals, from administering gender affirming care to individuals under the age of 19. The order also ended coverage for gender affirming care in government-provided medical benefits, and ordered the Office of Management and Budget to instruct private health insurers that government employee plans were barred from covering such care. Finally, the order directs the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement against female genital mutilation and develop legislation for a private right of action against medical professionals performing gender-affirming procedures, pursuant to an older statute against female genital mutilation. Three states and three physicians filed suit, arguing that Executive Order 14187 violates Fifth Amendment equal protection by creating classifications and facially discriminating on the basis of transgender status and sex without sufficient government interest. Plaintiffs also allege that the order violates separation of powers by imposing conditions on the receipt of funding by the plaintiff states’ medical institutions, whereas Congress never authorized such a provision and explicitly barred medical institutions from denying individuals access to federally funded services based on gender dysphoria under 29 U.S.C. § 794. Finally, the plaintiffs allege that the order violates the Tenth Amendment by regulating and threatening criminal prosecution against certain consensual medical practices, thus unlawfully intruding on the states’ traditional police powers over local public health.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, Judge Lauren King issued a two-week TRO, blocking enforcement of Section 4 and Section 8(a) of Executive Order 14187 within Plaintiff States; on Feb. 16, the court issued an Opinion in the matter.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the State of Colorado as a plaintiff and a Fifth Amendment Due Process claim for vagueness. Plaintiffs moved separately for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order, to which the government responded in opposition on Feb. 28.\nUpdated 4: On Feb. 28, Judge Lauren King issued an order granting the motion for a preliminary injunction, with one exception. The one exception involved Section 8(a) of the EO directing the Attorney General to prioritize “enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation”; but the court found “no credible threat of prosecution” for the plaintiffs. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 6, plaintiffs filed a motion for the court to hold defendants in contempt of court on shortened time, alleging that defendants tried to circumvent the preliminary injunction by falsely claiming actions taken to withhold funding under the enjoined EOs were actually taken pursuant to other policies. In the alternative, plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery as to whether defendants violated the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 13, defendants filed a memorandum opposing the motion for contempt, asserting that the relevant decisions to withhold funding were based on preexisting authority and not the enjoined EOs.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 14, plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for contempt or expedited discovery.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 17, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for contempt, but granted expedited discovery on the question of whether the actions were taken pursuant to the enjoined EOs.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 21, defendants appealed the district court’s partial grant of a preliminary injunction and grant of expedited discovery to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",

Finally, the order directs the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement against female genital mutilation and develop legislation for a private right of action against medical professionals performing gender-affirming procedures, pursuant to an older statute against female genital mutilation. Three states and three physicians filed suit, arguing that Executive Order 14187 violates Fifth Amendment equal protection by creating classifications and facially discriminating on the basis of transgender status and sex without sufficient government interest. Plaintiffs also allege that the order violates separation of powers by imposing conditions on the receipt of funding by the plaintiff states’ medical institutions, whereas Congress never authorized such a provision and explicitly barred medical institutions from denying individuals access to federally funded services based on gender dysphoria under 29 U.S.C. § 794. Finally, the plaintiffs allege that the order violates the Tenth Amendment by regulating and threatening criminal prosecution against certain consensual medical practices, thus unlawfully intruding on the states’ traditional police powers over local public health.<br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Feb. 7, Plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.11.0_1.pdf\">moved</a> for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Feb. 14, Judge Lauren King issued a two-week <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.158.0.pdf\">TRO</a>, blocking enforcement of Section 4 and Section 8(a) of Executive Order 14187 within Plaintiff States; on Feb. 16, the court issued an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.161.0.pdf\">Opinion</a> in the matter.<br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.164.0.pdf\">amended complaint</a> adding the State of Colorado as a plaintiff and a Fifth Amendment Due Process claim for vagueness.

The one exception involved Section 8(a) of the EO directing the Attorney General to prioritize “enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation”; but the court found “no credible threat of prosecution” for the plaintiffs. <br/>\n<strong>Update 5:</strong> On Mar. 6, plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.243.0.pdf\">filed a motion</a> for the court to hold defendants in contempt of court on shortened time, alleging that defendants tried to circumvent the preliminary injunction by falsely claiming actions taken to withhold funding under the enjoined EOs were actually taken pursuant to other policies. In the alternative, plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery as to whether defendants violated the preliminary injunction.<br/>\n<strong>Update 6: </strong>On Mar. 13, defendants <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.253.0.pdf\">filed a memorandum</a> opposing the motion for contempt, asserting that the relevant decisions to withhold funding were based on preexisting authority and not the enjoined EOs.<br/>\n<strong>Update 7:</strong> On Mar. 14, plaintiffs <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.254.0.pdf\">filed a reply</a> in support of their motion for contempt or expedited discovery.<br/>\n<strong>Update 8:</strong> On Mar. 17, the court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.258.0_2.pdf\">denied</a> plaintiffs’ motion for contempt, but granted expedited discovery on the question of whether the actions were taken pursuant to the enjoined EOs.<br/>\n<strong>Update 9: </strong>On Mar. 21, defendants <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.262.0_1.pdf\">appealed</a> the district court’s partial grant of a preliminary injunction and grant of expedited discovery to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</br>",

The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the EO unconstitutional and unlawful, immediately and permanently stop the EO from implementation, and void actions already taken under the EO.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. The order directed the Secretary of State to change policies related to documents like passports to align with the order’s definition of sex. The State Department subsequently stopped processing passport applications of individuals seeking to change their sex designation, or who selected an “X” designation. Plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, sued, arguing the policy is unconstitutional and violates the 5th Amendment’s equal protection guarantee by discriminating on the basis of sex and transgender status; violates the Fifth Amendment by restricting the right of free movement and travel; violates the Fifth Amendment by forcing disclosure of private and intimate information; and violates the First Amendment by compelling the speech of transgender applicants through their passports. Plaintiffs also argue the policy is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act, as contrary to constitutional rights, powers, and immunities; as an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and by failing to observe procedures as required by law in instituting the policy without a comment period. They seek a declaratory judgment that the policy is unconstitutional and unlawful; preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping the policy from being implemented; and an order vacating agency actions already taken under the policy.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 12, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 19, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs submitted a request to file a short, supplemental memorandum in support of their motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs’ memorandum provides additional arguments to support their request for the court to order Defendants to temporarily reinstate prior passport policy to restore the status quo.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 4, Defendants filed a supplemental memorandum in which they requested any warranted relief be issued in the form of a targeted injunction at the particular agency action held to be invalid and limited to the plaintiffs whom the State Department is held to have taken unlawful action against. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 18, Judge Julia Kobick granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The order enjoins Secretary of State Marco Rubio against enforcing the passport policy against Plaintiffs and requires that the State Department permit changes to Plaintiffs’ sex designations on their passports, but denies the request for a stay of the passport policy.",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A coalition of Quaker congregations sued the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), challenging a new policy allowing immigration enforcement in \"sensitive\" areas like places of worship. The coalition argues the policy violates constitutional rights and federal laws, and has asked the court to stop its implementation. The court partially granted their request by blocking any enforcement of the policy in or near any place of worship owned or used by the plaintiff organizations without a warrant.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive rescinding the Biden Administration’s guidelines for ICE and CBP enforcement actions that restricted agents from conducting immigration enforcement in or near “sensitive” areas, such as places of worship, schools, and hospitals.

The schools have asked the court to temporarily stop enforcement of the policy while the lawsuit is in progress. \nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive rescinding the Biden Administration’s guidelines for ICE and CBP enforcement actions that restricted agents from conducting immigration enforcement in or near “sensitive” areas, such as places of worship, schools, and hospitals. \nDenver Public Schools filed a suit challenging the recission of the policy, alleging that DHS implemented this major policy change through internal memoranda that have never been publicly released, with the shift announced only through a press release.

The Plaintiff argues that this reversal of a decades-old policy constitutes final agency action subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that DHS failed to meet the basic requirements for changing established policy — including the need to provide reasoned explanation for the change, consider reliance interests, and examine alternatives.

AP argues that this ban violates their constitutional rights, including their First Amendment right to free expression. AP asked the court to declare the ban unconstitutional and to reinstate their access to the White House immediately and at least for the duration of the lawsuit. The court initially denied their request for immediate reinstatement but accelerated the process for hearing both sides’ arguments, and more recently decided in favor of the AP to stop the White House action at least for the duration of the lawsuit.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, White House officials banned AP journalists from entering areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One as members of the press pool unless the AP began referring to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. On Feb. 21, the AP filed suit, claiming that the ban (1) violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause on the alleged grounds that the ban removes the AP from spaces it has used “for over a century” and was announced with no prior notice, no written notice, no opportunity to challenge before it took effect, and no formal opportunity to challenge since; and (2) violates the First Amendment on the alleged grounds that the ban is an attempt to compel the AP’s speech and retaliation for the AP’s exercise of its protected rights of expression. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that denying AP access is unconstitutional, and a court order that the White House rescind the policy.\nOn Feb. 21, 2025, the AP also filed a motion for a TRO and a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 24, in a 2-page order, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the motion for a temporary restraining order but noted that the court had ordered expedited hearings for consideration of a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs submitted an amended motion for a preliminary injunction, responding to Judge McFadden’s requests for briefings on specific questions, and requesting that the court require Defendants to rescind the ban on AP’s access to spaces open to the White House press pool.\nUpdate 3: Given the amended motion for a preliminary injunction, Judge McFadden ordered the Feb. 21 motion moot on Mar. 4. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 11, the Defendants filed a response opposing the Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. They argue that media organizations do not have a Fifth Amendment liberty interest in special access to the President and that it is not a violation of the First Amendment for the President to grant special media access based on the nature of a journalist’s prior coverage. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 25, the Defendants filed a supplemental declaration from Taylor Budowich, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Cabinet Secretary. The declaration provides some detail on the process for selecting press pool members and explains the access provided to the Plaintiff.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 8, the court granted a preliminary injunction on First Amendment grounds.\n",

A federal judge granted Perkins Coie’s request to temporarily block several sections of the EO.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 6, President Trump issued an executive order (EO) accusing the law firm Perkins Coie LLP of undermining democracy and maintaining illegal race-based hiring quotas. The executive order directs various agencies to impose sanctions against the firm, including: terminating the firm’s government contracts; suspending employees’ security clearances pending a national-security review; ordering a review of the firm’s hiring practices by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; limiting employees’ access to federal buildings; and directing agencies not to hire Perkins Coie employees. \nThe Plaintiff sued, alleging that the executive action is unconstitutional, violating separation of powers, the First Amendment’s protections for freedom of speech and association, the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. They seek a declaratory judgment that the order is unconstitutional and an immediate injunction stopping implementation of the order pending court review, followed by preliminary and permanent injunctions.\nThe Plaintiff also submitted a request for a temporary restraining order and a proposed order that enjoined only Sections 1 (Purpose), 3 (Contracting), and 5 (Personnel including access to Federal Government buildings) of the executive order. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, Judge Beryl Howell, ruling from the bench, granted Perkins Coie’s request for a temporary restraining order to block Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the executive order. During the hearing, she reportedly noted that the Plaintiff had not requested the TRO apply to Section 2 (Security Clearances) and Section 4 (Racial Discrimination) of the executive order, although those sections are also part of the lawsuit. She followed hours later with a written order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, the Defendant filed a motion to disqualify the judge. On Mar. 26, the court denied the motion.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 2, Perkins Coie filed a motion for summary judgment and requested the court to permanently block Defendants from enforcing the EO. Perkins Coie argues the Court should declare the EO unlawful for violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, exceeds the President’s constitutional authority under Article II, and violates the separation of powers. \nOn that same day, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint, arguing that the EO directs the review of Perkins Coie to ensure that the Federal Government’s dealings with the firm are consistent with national security and other public interests. Defendants also filed a motion to reconsider the scope of TRO granted on Mar. 12, arguing it is overly broad because the United States is not a proper defendant.",

The EO suspends the security clearances of Susman Godfrey employees, requires government contractors to disclose any business with Susman and threatens the termination of the government contracts, bars Susman employees from federal buildings, limits the engagement of government officials with Susman employees, and prohibits agencies from hiring Susman employees. Susman alleges that the EO violates the First and Fifth Amendments, the Spending Clause, and is outside the President’s scope of authority.\n\nCase Summary: On Apr. 9, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) against Susman Godfrey, a Texas-based trial firm. The EO orders heads of executive agencies to suspend security clearances held by Susman employees. It also orders agencies to require government contractors to disclose any business with Susman and to review contracts with contractors that disclose doing so. It also requires agencies to terminate all contracts with Susman. Finally, the EO bars Susman employees from accessing federal buildings, limits the interactions of government personnel with Susman employees, and prohibits agencies from hiring Susman employees. Susman sued over 50 federal defendants to challenge the Order. Susman argues that it faces irreparable reputational and economic harm. \nSusman claims that the EO violates the First Amendment because it constitutes both government retaliation for the Firm’s engagement in protected speech and viewpoint discrimination. The Firm also alleges the EO violates its First Amendment right to petition the government and freedom of association. Susman additionally claims that the conditions placed on government contracts are in violation of the Spending Clause. Susman also argues that the EO violates the Fifth Amendment in multiple ways. It violates the Due Process Clause because of the absence of procedural due process and because the EO is unconstitutionally vague; it violates the right to counsel; and it violates equal protection rights. Finally, Susman argues that the EO is an ultra vires action that exceeds the President’s scope of authority as it violates the separation of powers. \nSusman requests the Court block the Defendants from implementing the EO and order them to cancel any guidance implementing the EO that has already been issued. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, Susman filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order asking the court to block the enforcement of EO Sections 1 (Background), 3 (Contracting), and 5 (Personnel, including access to Federal Buildings).

These letters requested information about these law firms’ hiring practices, including the personally identifiable information of lawyers employed with these firms and law students that have applied for positions at these firms. Plaintiffs allege that these investigations are outside of the authority of the EEOC and violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. They have asked the Court to order the EEOC to stop investigating law firms in excess of their authority and return and delete any information that has already been collected pursuant to the investigation of these firms.\nCase Summary:  On Mar. 6, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14230 titled “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP.” This EO directed the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to review the hiring practices of law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. On Mar. 17, 2025, Acting Chair of the EEOC Andrea Lucas sent letters to 20 law firms asking about DEI-related employment practices, including requests for personally identifiable information of lawyers employed by these firms and law students who had applied for positions. Plaintiffs are three current law school students who applied to work at some of the law firm recipients of these letters. They allege that much of the information requested is sensitive or confidential, and that their privacy will be harmed if law firms provide that information to the EEOC. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ sending these letters constitutes an ultra vires action that is outside of the EEOC’s authority because 1) the EEOC has started this investigation without a charge being filed, 2) the investigation is being conducted publicly, and 3) the EEOC lacked relevant quorum when issuing these letters. Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants acted in violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Plaintiffs request that the Court declare that sending the letters was an ultra vires action, order Defendants to withdraw the Mar. 17 letters, enjoin them from conducting investigations of law firms that do not meet Title VII requirements, and order them to return any information already collected pursuant to the letters and delete that information from their databases.

The EO also directs the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, and it conditions various federal funding on compliance with the Executive Order.\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democratic Governors Association, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries challenged the EO, alleging that the President does not have legal authority to impose these policy changes, and that the Constitution reserves such authority to the states and to Congress. They further allege that the EO will make it harder to register to vote, cast a ballot, and to administer fair elections, and that it violates individual privacy rights.\nPlaintiffs brought 11 counts, alleging (1) Ultra Vires presidential action; (2) Violation of the Separation of Powers with respect to various congressional and state authorities; (3) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) violations with respect to various statutes; and (4) APA violations with respect to various constitutional provisions.\nPlaintiffs requested that the court declare the relevant sections of the EO unlawful and preliminarily and permanently enjoin the various government departments from taking any action to implement the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 3, this case was consolidated with League of Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President (complaint) and League of Women Voters Education Fund v. Trump (complaint). These cases will proceed under League of United Latin American Citizens v.

Plaintiffs argue that President Donald Trump lacks authority to impose the proposed changes to elections law, and requested the court declare these provisions unconstitutional and void, and to enjoin enforcement of these provisions. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 25, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.” Among its requirements, the EO directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship on voter registration forms and provides that the  Department of Homeland Security and Department of Government Efficiency shall review each state’s voter registration lists. The EO also directs the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, and it conditions various federal funding on compliance with the EO.\nPlaintiffs are 19 States that allege the President lacks authority to make the proposed changes to election law, that the EO infringes on the authority of States and Congress to determine election law, and that the EO would impose significant burden on the States to begin immediately conforming to the proposed new policy changes. Plaintiffs challenged six provisions of the EO: (1) Section 2(a), which requires the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship in its national mail voter registration form; (2) Section 2(d), which requires Federal voter registration departments or agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing a Federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs; (3) Section 3(d), which requires the Secretary of Defense to require documentary proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application pursuant to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Voting Absentee Voting Act; (4) Section 4(a), which requires the EAC to freeze funds to States that do not implement these documentary requirements; (5) Section 7(a), which directs the Attorney General to enforce a new statutory interpretation to disallow counting of ballots received after Election Day; and (6) Section 7(b), which directs the EAC to condition funding to States based on adherence to this interpretation of Election Day.\nPlaintiffs allege that the President does not have authority to implement these changes to election law. Specifically, they argue that these provisions of the EO are unconstitutional under the Bicameralism, Presentment, Elections, and Electors Clauses (depending on the provisions), ultra vires, in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, violate Separation of Powers, and violate State sovereignty. \nPlaintiffs have requested the court declare the challenged provisions unconstitutional and void, and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin all Defendants except President Trump from implementing or enforcing the challenged provisions.",

The EO also directs the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, and it conditions various federal funding on compliance with the EO.<br/>\nPlaintiffs are 19 States that allege the President lacks authority to make the proposed changes to election law, that the EO infringes on the authority of States and Congress to determine election law, and that the EO would impose significant burden on the States to begin immediately conforming to the proposed new policy changes. Plaintiffs challenged six provisions of the EO: (1) Section 2(a), which requires the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship in its national mail voter registration form; (2) Section 2(d), which requires Federal voter registration departments or agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing a Federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs; (3) Section 3(d), which requires the Secretary of Defense to require documentary proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application pursuant to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Voting Absentee Voting Act; (4) Section 4(a), which requires the EAC to freeze funds to States that do not implement these documentary requirements; (5) Section 7(a), which directs the Attorney General to enforce a new statutory interpretation to disallow counting of ballots received after Election Day; and (6) Section 7(b), which directs the EAC to condition funding to States based on adherence to this interpretation of Election Day.<br/>\nPlaintiffs allege that the President does not have authority to implement these changes to election law. Specifically, they argue that these provisions of the EO are unconstitutional under the Bicameralism, Presentment, Elections, and Electors Clauses (depending on the provisions), ultra vires, in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, violate Separation of Powers, and violate State sovereignty. <br/>\nPlaintiffs have requested the court declare the challenged provisions unconstitutional and void, and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin all Defendants except President Trump from implementing or enforcing the challenged provisions.</br>",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Several organizations, including the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, sued President Donald Trump alleging his Executive Orders 14151 and 14173 (“EOs”) that target diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) programs violate their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech. The organizations are asking the judge to declare both EOs unconstitutional and unlawful, and to stop enforcement of the EOs immediately and at least for the duration of the lawsuit. The judge has partially granted the organization’s request by stopping enforcement of the EOs while the lawsuit is pending. The Trump administration has appealed the judge’s decision to a higher court.  \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to “[defend] women from gender ideology extremism and [restore] biological truth to the federal government.” That same day, the President issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and “equity-related” grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, the administration issued a third executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. \nPlaintiffs argue the first order is an unconstitutional violation of the Spending Clause and the 5th Amendment’s due process guarantee for vagueness. They argue the second order unconstitutionally violates 5th Amendment due process for vagueness; the 1st Amendment’s free speech clause; and the separation of powers. They seek declaratory judgments that both orders are unlawful and unconstitutional, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against both.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Orders.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 18, Defendants filed a response against Plaintiffs' motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, arguing, inter alia, that two of four Plaintiffs lack standing and that Plaintiffs' claims fail on merits. On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief in support for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 21, Judge Adam B. Abelson issued a memorandum opinion and granted the preliminary injunction in large part, enjoining implementation of the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 and of the Certification and Enforcement Threat Provisions of Executive Order 14173. The court stated that “Plaintiffs’ irreparable harms include widespread chilling of unquestionably protected speech.\" The court also denied the preliminary injunction in part, allowing the Attorney General to prepare the report pursuant to Executive Order 14173 and to engage in an investigation.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 24, the Defendant submitted a notice of appeal to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 3, Judge Abelson denied the Defendants' motion to stay the injunction pending an appeal.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 10, Judge Abelson granted Plaintiff’s motion to clarify the scope of the injunction, such that it applies not only to “persons in active concert or participation with defendants,” but to all federal executive branch agencies.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 14, the Fourth Circuit granted the government’s petition for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction granted by Judge Abelson on Feb. 21 in light of the Fourth Circuit’s grant of stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. Plaintiffs seek to vacate so that they can instead seek additional relief that takes into account new factual developments and also save judicial resources. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 1, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, asserting that the district court lacks the jurisdiction to do so after a notice of appeal has been filed.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 2, Plaintiffs filed a reply in further support of their motion to vacate the preliminary injunction order and requested the Court grant this motion as soon as possible.

The officers argued that the ODNI terminated them without sufficient cause, in violation of the agency’s legal obligations and their constitutional rights, and asked the court to immediately block ODNI’s actions. A federal court has permitted ODNI to proceed but has extended the officers’ deadline to resign voluntarily in return for additional time on paid leave.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and “equity-related” grants and contracts. \nPlaintiffs are U.S. intelligence officers who were assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives at ODNI and CIA. The complaint alleges that Defendants placed Plaintiffs on administrative leave “apparently only because of [Plaintiffs’] temporary assignments to personnel functions involving DEIA.” Plaintiffs bring several causes of action. First, they claim that Defendants violated the Administrative Leave Act by placing Plaintiffs on leave for more than ten work days, despite the fact that no worker misconduct had been alleged. Second, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act, because Plaintiffs’ “imminent termination” is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with [Intelligence Community] regulations, and unsupported by any evidentiary record whatsoever.” Third, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the First and Fifth Amendments by firing Plaintiffs on the basis of “their assumed beliefs about a domestic political issue [DEIA]” and causing them to lose “their property interest in their employment without due process of law.”\nThe plaintiffs seek injunctive relief. The plaintiffs also submitted a request for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 1: On Feb 18, the court issued an administrative stay blocking the termination of plaintiffs’ employment or placing plaintiffs on leave without pay.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 20, Defendants filed a motion in opposition to the plaintiffs’ request for a TRO. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 27, the court vacated its prior administrative stay and denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge Anthony Trenga extended the employees’ deadline to accept the administration’s deferred resignation program to Monday, March 3. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction with a memorandum in support.",

First, they claim that Defendants violated the Administrative Leave Act by placing Plaintiffs on leave for more than ten work days, despite the fact that no worker misconduct had been alleged. Second, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act, because Plaintiffs’ “imminent termination” is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with [Intelligence Community] regulations, and unsupported by any evidentiary record whatsoever.” Third, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the First and Fifth Amendments by firing Plaintiffs on the basis of “their <em>assumed</em> beliefs about a domestic political issue [DEIA]” and causing them to lose “their property interest in their employment without due process of law.”<br/>\nThe plaintiffs seek injunctive relief. The plaintiffs also submitted a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69646552/doe-1-v-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence/#entry-12\">request</a> for a temporary restraining order.<br/>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Feb 18, the court <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69646552/doe-1-v-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence/#entry-12\">issued</a> an administrative stay blocking the termination of plaintiffs’ employment or placing plaintiffs on leave without pay.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> On Feb. 20, Defendants <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742.14.0.pdf\">filed</a> a motion in opposition to the plaintiffs’ request for a TRO. <br/>\n<strong>Update 3:</strong> On Feb. 27, the court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742.26.0.pdf\">vacated</a> its prior administrative stay and denied plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge Anthony Trenga extended the employees’ deadline to accept the administration’s deferred resignation program to Monday, March 3. <br/>\n<strong>Update 4</strong>: On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs submitted a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742.32.0.pdf\">motion</a> for a preliminary injunction with a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742/gov.uscourts.vaed.568742.33.0.pdf\">memorandum</a> in support.</br>",

                            "case_summary": "Overview:  A women’s nonprofit trade organization has sued President Donald Trump  alleging two Executive Orders (“EO”) that target diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)  violate the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Spending Clause, and separation of powers. The organization has asked the judge to temporarily or permanently block the orders and affirm that they are unconstitutional. The judge has since blocked the Department of Labor (DOL) from acting pursuant to certain provisions of these EOs.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to “[defend] women from gender ideology extremism and [restore] biological truth to the federal government.” That same day, the President issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and “equity-related” grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, the administration issued a third executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. \nPlaintiff, a non-profit organization that works to train women to enter and remain in high-skilled trades, filed suit, arguing the executives orders (1) violate the First Amendment due to (a) overbreadth and vagueness; (b) viewpoint discrimination; and (c) setting unconstitutional conditions on speech; (2) violate the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause for vagueness; (3) are ultra vires violations of Article I, Sec. 8 (the Spending Clause); and (4) violate the separation of powers. The Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgments that the orders are unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining their enforcement.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 5, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the implementation of the DEI Executive Orders. On Mar. 18, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent the federal government from taking adverse action against any recipient of federal funding resulting from the DEI Executive Orders.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 24, the government filed an opposition to  Plaintiff’s motions for a TRO and a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 26, Judge Matthew Kennelly granted a TRO.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 1, the court issued an order granting an amended TRO. The amended TRO provides that the Secretary of Labor and employees or advisors of the Department of Labor (DOL) may not pause, freeze, or cancel any awards, contracts, or obligations made to Plaintiff on the basis of the termination provision of January 20 EO, and that the enjoined parties cannot require certification or other representations under the certification provision of the January 21 EO.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 3, the government filed a second memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing the nationwide injunction requested by the Plaintiff should not be implemented.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 7, Plaintiff filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction in which it requested a nationwide preliminary injunction covering all federal agencies.

Harvard, which bans race-based affirmative action.

Protect Democracy requests that the court declare OMB’s decision unlawful and order OMB to restore the website.\nCase Summary: On or around Mar. 24, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) took down a publicly accessible website and database that it had previously maintained making available documents related to OMB decisions regarding apportionment of congressionally appropriated funds. On Apr. 15, Protect Democracy Project, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, sued OMB and its director, Russell Voight, alleging that OMB is statutorily required to maintain this database and website. The Plaintiff claims that taking down the website has made it impossible for them to monitor the appropriation of funds and, in particular, has forced them to shut down OpenOMB, a site they operate, which pulls primary source data from OMB’s site and creates a user-friendly interface used regularly by Congress, litigants and a wide variety of other users seeking to monitor appropriations.\nProtect Democracy argues that OMB’s decision to take down this website and database is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it violates (1) the 2022 and 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Acts, which together established the directive to create and maintain this database and website; and (2) the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires that agencies provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination products. Project Democracy also argues that the decision was arbitrary and capricious under the APA.\nProtect Democracy has asked the court to declare that OMB’s decision unlawful, and to grant a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring OMB to restore the website and make all relevant information available.",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (a non-profit government watchdog) sued the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”) and related federal officials, alleging violations of transparency laws and seeking the preservation and release of certain DOGE records before a March 14 congressional funding deadline.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff claims that the United States DOGE Service (USDS) “has provided no meaningful transparency into its operations or assurances that it is maintaining proper records.” The complaint alleges that Defendants have refused to comply with FOIA requests for records and demands for records preservation under the Federal Records Act (FRA). Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief requiring Defendants to comply with Plaintiff’s FOIA requests, to fully comply with the FRA’s preservation requirements, and to initiate enforcement action through the Attorney General to recover any lost or destroyed USDS records. Plaintiff also filed a motion, with a supporting memorandum, for preliminary injunction to require Defendants to release records in advance of the March 14 conclusion of the congressional appropriations process.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 10, Judge Christopher Cooper granted in part and denied in part CREW’s request for a preliminary junction. In an accompanying memorandum opinion, the judge found that USDS “is likely covered by FOIA” and ordered it to process CREW’s request for records “on an expedited timetable,” but denied CREW’s request for an order demanding that OMB and USDS release records by the day of the order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 14, USDS filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction. USDS also requested an expedited briefing schedule on USDS’s upcoming motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 19, USDS filed a motion for summary judgment. In an accompanying memorandum, USDS reasserted that, because it does not wield substantial independent authority, it is not an agency and is therefore not subject to FOIA or the FRA.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 26, USDS filed their answer to CREW’s complaint, largely denying CREW’s claims and reasserting defenses that USDS is not an agency subject to FOIA or the FRA; CREW is not entitled to information exempt from FOIA disclosure; and USDS’s actions did not violate FOIA, the FRA, or any other statutory or regulatory provision.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 27, CREW filed a motion for expedited discovery to allow them to gather information regarding USDS’s agency status and whether it is subject to FOIA and the FRA. CREW argued that it needs this discovery in order to respond to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.",

They seek preservation of records and compliance with the FRA and APA’s obligations. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 24, The Atlantic reported that members of the Trump administration used the commercial messaging app Signal to discuss military operations in Yemen (see also Mar. 26 follow-up report). Signal messages are not automatically forwarded to government email addresses, and the app has a functionality that allows messages to auto-delete, which was allegedly enabled during the Yemen discussions. American Oversight, a nonprofit focused on government transparency that regularly files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the federal government, filed suit against federal agency officials and the National Archives, arguing they are injured because government use of Signal prevents Plaintiffs from receiving lawfully requested records. Plaintiffs allege Defendants’ use of Signal violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because (1) Defendants' use Signal is not in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA) and amounts to removal and destruction of agency records; and (2) National Archives defendants should have known records were being removed and destroyed (the acting National Archivist, Marco Rubio, was allegedly in the group Signal chat) and failed to take nondiscretionary actions to preserve them under the FRA. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgments that messages sent through Signal in the course of agency business are subject to the FRA, that failure to preserve them is a violation of the FRA, and that defendants have violated the FRA. They seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief ordering defendants to preserve records in accordance with the law.\n\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 26, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to order Defendants to stop allegedly destroying records, initiate actions to recover any destroyed records related to the Yemen Signal chat, and take steps to confirm that any use of a messaging app with an auto-delete function complies with the Federal Records Act.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 27, after a hearing, Chief Judge James Boasberg issued an order, “as agreed by the parties,” for “Defendants shall promptly make best efforts to preserve all Signal communications from March 11-15, 2025.” The court also ordered defendants to file a status report by Mar. 31 “setting forth the steps that they have taken to implement such preservation.”\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 10, following a hearing, the court ordered the Defendants to provide supplemental declarations to address “specific clarifications” missing from the first round of declarations.",

They allege that the Executive Orders and related proclamations will increase the cost of goods for the tribal community in their personal and business lives.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that President Trump acted ultra vires in establishing the tariffs on goods from Canada, because the President does not have constitutional or statutory authority to impose tariffs, and that these tariffs would violate the Jay Treaty exempting Native Americans from being subject to duties or tariffs when crossing the border. Plaintiffs also argue that the IEEPA does not empower the President to establish tariffs. They further allege that the Executive Orders and related proclamations violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that the Executive Orders and related proclamations are unconstitutionally vague.\n\nPlaintiffs requested that the court declare the Executive Orders and related proclamations unconstitutional as violative of the Separation of Powers, Article I, Article VI, and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and of the Jay Treaty.

They alleged that the imposition of across-the-board tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA and in any event exceeds the Defendants' executive authority as they were implemented without congressional approval.\n\nCase Summary: On Apr. 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14257 (the “Liberation Day Order”) imposing incremental tariffs of 10% on all imports into the United States as well as elevated tariffs on individual countries.  Subsequent EOs, including EO 14266 and additional memoranda, paused many of the elevated tariffs but increased the tariff on most goods from China to 145%. As the statutory basis for the Liberation Day Order, the EO cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  (IEEPA), which provides the President with certain authority in the event of “an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.” The Liberation Day Order asserts that the existence of bilateral trade deficits in goods constitutes a national emergency.\nOn Apr. 14, five owner-operated businesses, which are unable to source their products or raw materials domestically and therefore rely on international imports to run their companies, sued President Trump and various government agencies, alleging that the levying of tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA. They contend that given the significance of the economic impact on the United States, the “major questions doctrine” requires that Congress must have clearly delegated authority for tariffs under the IEEPA. Plaintiffs also argue that in any event a trade deficit in goods is neither an emergency nor an unusual or extraordinary threat, and that if the IEEPA did extend such power to the President, it would be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress’s power to impose tariffs.\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgement that the IEEPA does not provide statutory authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, that neither the national emergency nor the “unusual and extraordinary threat” required by the IEEPA has been identified, and that the imposition of tariffs under the EO’s is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and seek the enjoin the operation of the Liberation Day Order and EO 14266.\n\n",

                            "case_summary": "Overview:  The State of California brought suit against President Donald Trump and his administration, challenging various Executive Orders that implement tariffs purportedly authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). California alleged that the imposition of across-the-board tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA, and is a violation of the Separation of Powers.\nCase Summary: On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14193 (Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border), and on Apr. 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14257 (the “Liberation Day Order”). Together, these Executive Orders impose a broad tariff regime on imports from countries around the world. Plaintiffs California Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California brought suit alleging that the President does not have authority to impose the tariffs outlined in the Executive Orders. California claims that the tariffs will create substantial economic harm to the state in various forms, including lost tax revenue and impacts to the State’s ability to import and export goods.\nCalifornia alleges that the President lacks authority to impose the tariffs described by the Executive Orders. California argues that the power to levy tariffs is exclusive to Congress, and that Congress can and has delegated this authority to the executive branch via statute. The Executive Orders invoked the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) as the source of authority for the tariffs. However, California alleges that the IEEPA confers only limited authority to the President, and that it does not provide the President with authority to impose tariffs. Instead, California argues that other statutes grant the President authority to levy tariffs, but that those statutes require substantial process and congressional participation, which did not occur in this instance. The State brought two counts, arguing that the tariffs are ultra vires and a violation of the Separation of Powers. California has asked the court to declare the tariffs unlawful and void, and to enjoin Defendants from taking any action to implement the Executive Orders.",

A federal court temporarily blocked the EO while the lawsuit is pending on the basis that it likely violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Trump has appealed the court’s decision.</em><br/><br/> <br>\n<strong>Case Summary:</strong> Trump’s executive order seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants on the basis that people in the United States illegally are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Four states sued to protect residents who would lose their citizenship under the executive order. The suit argues that the plain text of the 14th Amendment, as confirmed in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), explicitly grants birthright citizenship for all people born in the United States.<br>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Jan. 23, 2025, Judge John Coughenour of the Western District of Washington <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25502861/tro-on-trump-executive-order-birthright-citizenship.pdf\"><u>issued a temporary restraining order</u></a> against the Executive Order.<br/>\n<strong>Update 2: </strong>On Jan. 27, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69576744/franco-aleman-v-trump/\"><em>Franco Aleman v.

The Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the ACLU had previously sued to challenge a Biden administration rule that limited asylum access to those presenting at a port of entry or falling under another narrow exception.

On Jan. 22, 2025, the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) issued a stop-work order that halted funding for four programs providing legal resources to unrepresented people facing deportation. The EOIR action was taken purportedly to “audit” the programs pursuant to the Trump administration executive order. Nine advocacy and immigrant legal services organizations sued, arguing that terminating funding for the programs is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); violates the Appropriations Clause in the case of the LOP and ICH; and violates the First Amendment by denying the plaintiffs access to courthouses and immigration detention centers.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Three nonprofit organizations challenged a proclamation by President Donald Trump that disallows immigrants from remaining in the U.S. while pursuing asylum claims. The lawsuit argues that the proclamation  violates multiple laws and Constitutional provisions. After the Trump administration agreed not to use the proclamation to deport individual asylum-seekers during the litigation, a federal judge denied the emergency motion to pause the implementation of the proclamation.\nCase Summary: Trump’s proclamation bars immigrants who arrive after the date of the proclamation from invoking provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would permit them to remain in the United States while pursuing asylum claims. The plaintiffs, three nonprofit organizations in Texas and Arizona providing legal services and assistance to undocumented individuals or asylum seekers, argue that the order violates the following statutory and constitutional provisions:\n1. the Asylum Statute in the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (by barring noncitizens from applying for asylum in direct contradiction to congressional protections);\n2. the Withholding of Removal Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (by preventing noncitizens from seeking protection from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion);\n3. the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (by depriving noncitizens of a meaningful opportunity to present CAT claims and shielding them from potential torture);\n4. the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D) (by denying unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries their statutory right to regular removal proceedings);\n5. the INA’s procedural protections for removal, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1229a, 1225(b) (by overriding mandated removal proceedings and eliminating procedural protections, including credible fear screenings);\n6. the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (by implementing policies that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law) and § 706(2)(D) (by failing to follow the required rulemaking process before enacting sweeping changes to statutory protections); and \n7. the constitutional separation of powers (by exceeding presidential authority and unlawfully overriding congressionally enacted immigration protections).\nThe Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the proclamation is unlawful and an injunction stopping its implementation.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to stay removal of individual plaintiff non-citizens who are currently detained by the Defendants and could be imminently deported under the proclamation. On Feb. 20, Judge Moss issued an administrative stay in the case until 12 pm on Feb. 24 to allow the government time to gather information to respond, and time for expedited briefing. The court further ordered the Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for a stay of removal by Feb. 21.  \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 22, Judge Moss denied as moot the emergency motion to stay removal of individual asylum-seekers because the government agreed not to use President Trump’s January 2025 border proclamation to remove them during the litigation. The court ordered that the government must provide at least seven days’ notice before removing any of the plaintiffs during the case and vacated the scheduled hearing.",

Plaintiffs argue that the U.S. government’s actions violate the Constitution and immigration law and ask the court to allow detainees to have access to lawyers and to have their locations disclosed. \nCase Summary: Trump’s Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Plaintiffs are suing on behalf of the families of four Venezuelan nationals who are believed to have been transferred to Guantánamo. Plaintiffs allege the government’s action violates habeas corpus rights, Fifth Amendment Due Process rights, and the Immigration and Naturalization Act’s guarantee of the right to counsel. Plaintiffs further allege that the government’s alleged restriction of information in and out of Guantánamo violates both the plaintiffs’ and the detainees’ First Amendment rights. They seek court orders declaring that the government’s actions violate those rights, permitting access to lawyers, requiring the government to identify the location of detainees held at Guantánamo, requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer to a foreign jurisdiction, and requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer of additional noncitizens to Guantánamo.\n\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 20, the government filed a notice that DHS had removed the immigration detainees from Guantánamo, which the government asserted “eliminates any need for temporary injunctive relief.” Just prior, it filed its Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order arguing, among other things, that the Plaintiffs (family members of individuals who had been held at Guantánamo, and advocacy organizations) lacked standing because they were not themselves detained, that the District Court lacked statutory authority to require the government to provide notice before transferring individuals into or out of Guantánamo, and denying the validity of Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Plaintiffs filed a Reply reasserting their request for a TRO to prevent the government from sending more detainees to Guantánamo.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a Reply explaining that in spite of the administration’s Feb. 20 notice that all immigrant detainees had been transferred off Guantánamo and the TRO was moot, they had learned via social media that another group of immigrants was being sent to Guantánamo. The Reply adds further factual allegations and legal arguments that immigrant detainees are prevented from having real meaningful access to legal representation. These include that (1) the government and guards at the detention camp do not allow detainees to make phone calls, including by saying “this is a terrorist prison and there is no capacity to make calls” and by limiting available phones and times such that most people cannot use them; (2) unrepresented detainees transferred to Guantanamo do not have access to a legal directory, know your rights briefings, or practical means to meet counsel; and (3) retained counsel face numerous obstacles to representing their clients, including that only five detainees can make phone calls each day, there are no means for attorneys to initiate contact with their clients, and there is no way to transfer or sign paperwork other than the government's announced policy to “generally follow the procedures used in the habeas litigation involving law of war detainees,” and to transfer mail to detainees from Washington, D.C. on a weekly basis. \nPlaintiffs argue that these restrictions violate detainees’ First and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as their statutory right to counsel under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as the plaintiff advocacy organizations’ First Amendment rights.

The lawsuit argues that these actions violate the Refugee Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and Constitutional due process rights. A federal judge has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring implementation of the EO and the notice.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Ten plaintiffs — individual refugees, U.S. citizens, and resettlement organizations (HIAS, Church World Service, and Lutheran Community Services Northwest) — filed a proposed class action seeking injunctions to block implementation of the orders, declaratory judgments that the actions are unlawful, maintenance of refugee processing and resettlement services consistent with the status quo, and confirmation of compliance with such remedies if granted. The lawsuit alleges that the orders have left approved refugees stranded internationally, denied recent arrivals statutorily-mandated support services, and forced layoffs at resettlement institutions. \nThe complaint asserts that the executive orders violate the Refugee Act’s comprehensive statutory scheme for refugee policy, are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act for circumventing notice-and-comment requirements and failing to establish a reasoned basis for the change in policy, and breach agency regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 207.7 governing the Follow-to-Join process in violation of the Accardi doctrine requiring government officials to follow the agency’s own rules and procedures. The lawsuit further argues that the orders violate the Fifth Amendment due process rights of U.S. citizens petitioning for family reunification, and violate fundamental separation of powers principles by attempting to redistribute or withhold congressionally appropriated funds to achieve policy objectives.\nUpdate 1: Judge Jamal Whitehead, ruling from the bench, issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the executive order. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 25, Judge Jamal Whitehead, ruling from the bench, issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the executive order. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 28, Judge Whitehead issued a written opinion granting the nationwide preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, the government submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.

USCCB argues the Trump administration’s actions are illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act and seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from implementing the suspension. A federal judge refused to immediately stop the U.S. government’s actions but agreed to speed up the process for deciding whether to block them.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Plaintiff, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), is part of a public-private partnership with the federal government through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and was providing transitionary resettlement services to more than 6,700 refugees when the State Department suspended funding. USCCB brought suit, arguing the government policy suspending funds for the Refugee Admissions Program is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act because it (1) violates the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the Refugee Act of 1980, and the Impoundment Control Act; (2) is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and (3) is a substantive role promulgated without required notice-and-comment rulemaking. They seek a declaratory judgment that the suspension is unlawful, and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions prohibiting the government from implementing the suspension and requiring the government to make reimbursements pursuant to the terms of its cooperative agreements.\nUpdate 1: On Feb 20, 2025, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the request for a temporary restraining order, but ordered an expedited briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction motion.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, an amended motion for a preliminary injunction, and a memorandum in support of that motion; and Judge McFadden ruled that the prior motions for a preliminary injunction are moot in light of the new motion. The amended complaint and the amended motion for a preliminary injunction are in response to new developments in the case, e.g., on Feb. 27, the State Department terminated the cooperative agreements with USCCB for refugee resettlement. This termination changed the nature of the dispute from a suspension of funding to a complete cancellation of the contracts.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, the government filed in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction and the following day, on Mar. 6, the plaintiffs filed a reply.",

Several advocacy organizations sued, arguing that the order violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which bars the delegation of decision-making authority to private citizens without public access. The suit asks the court to enjoin the operation of DOGE unless and until it complies with the FACA’s requirements.<br>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Feb. 18, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb (D.D.C) <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69559444/public-citizen-inc-v-trump/?order_by=desc\">granted</a> defendants’ motion in <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69559444/public-citizen-inc-v-trump/\"><em>Public Citizen, Inc. v.

Individuals claiming to be OPM employees subsequently posted online that the emails were being stored on an unsecure server at OPM. Plaintiffs, employees of executive-branch agencies who received “test” emails from HR@opm.gov requesting information, sued. The lawsuit alleges that the new procedure violates the E-Government Act of 2002 and asks the court to require the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment before collecting any data from employees, as required under the law.\nUpdate 1 and 2: On Feb. 4, 2025, the plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order. On Feb. 6, Judge Randolph D. Moss denied the TRO request and said an opinion will follow.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 11, OPM moved to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing and failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 17, 2025, in a Memorandum Opinion and Order, Judge Moss denied plaintiffs’ most recent motion for a TRO on the ground that they had not shown they were likely to have standing or face irreparable injury without emergency relief.

A federal court temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to certain payment records maintained by the Treasury Department containing sensitive data while the case proceeds, citing potential violations of federal law.   \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs, attorneys general of 19 states, sued on the ground that the policy of giving expanded access to political appointees and “special government employees” to Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Services violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claim the policy violates the APA by exceeding authority conferred by statute for the unauthorized purpose of impeding payments and accessing private information; for failure to conduct a privacy impact statement; for violation of the Privacy Act; and for violating ethics statutes on conflicts of interest. The plaintiffs also assert the policy usurps congressional authority and is ultra virus.\nThe plaintiffs requested an emergency temporary restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunction to bar access to political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from other agencies as well as to any person who has not received a background check, security clearance, and information security training.\nUpdate 1: The case is before Judge Jeannette A. Vargas. On Feb. 8, 2025, after midnight, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued an emergency temporary restraining order until Judge Vargas holds a hearing on Feb. 14. Judge Engelmayer’s order prohibits access to the Treasury Department’s systems and also requires prohibited persons to immediately destroy any material already downloaded from the Treasury Department’s systems.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Judge Vargas granted a limited preliminary injunction, enjoining the Treasury Department from granting access to DOGE-affiliated individuals to any payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees. The court noted that “a real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law.”  The court ordered the Treasury Department to submit a report by March 24 including several forms of information and certifications including “the vetting and security clearances processes that members of the Treasury DOGE Team have undergone;” ”setting forth the legal authority pursuant to which each DOGE Team member was employed by or detailed to the Treasury Department;” and “explaining the reporting chains that govern the relationship between the DOGE Team members, USDS/DOGE, and Treasury leadership.”",

A federal court denied requests to temporarily block DOGE’s access while the case proceeds, but indicated further analysis was needed in particular on the Economy Act claims. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 5, 2025, DOGE sought access to internal information systems at the Department of Labor. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE’s attempt to direct the agency and access internal information systems are an unlawful exercise of power beyond its authority; and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act as a prohibited personnel practice, violation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, violation of the Privacy Act, rulemaking without proper procedure, and arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion. They seek temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Department of Labor from granting access to DOGE, from taking adverse action against employees who refuse to cooperate with DOGE, and from providing any person with non-public Department of Labor information regarding that person’s business interests or direct competitors. \nOn the same day as the complaint was filed, judge John Bates issued an Order which stated, “Defendants represented to the Court that DOL [Department of Labor] will not allow DOGE access to any DOL data until after this Court rules on the TRO motion on Friday.”\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Judge Bates denied the petition for a temporary restraining order on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs submitted a renewed request for a TRO enjoining agency defendants from granting members of DOGE access to their systems of records, except as consistent with applicable federal law.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, Judge Bates denied the renewed request for a TRO, but added, “On the Economy Act question, which is the most important for this denial of a TRO, the Court will benefit from further briefing and analysis on a motion for preliminary injunction.”\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 27, Judge Bates ordered limited expedited discovery in the case in the form of answers to written interrogatories, production of documents, and the deposition of four individuals (one each from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and DOGE), to last no more than eight hours in aggregate.",

A federal court denied the request to temporarily block DOGE’s access while the case proceeds. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 3, 2025, reportedly 20 people affiliated with DOGE were working with the Department of Education, some of whom obtained access to sensitive internal information systems, including systems related to federal student aid. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE’s access is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act in that it is contrary to law in violation of the Privacy Act and Internal Revenue Code; arbitrary and capricious; and in excess of statutory authority. They seek a declaratory judgment that DOGE officials are not authorized to access Department of Education records that contain personal information, and temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief preventing the Department of Education from continuing to provide access to DOGE, ensuring there is no further dissemination of data, and requiring recovery of unlawfully transferred information.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, Plaintiff moved for a TRO, requesting Defendants be enjoined from disclosing information about individuals to individuals affiliated with DOGE, and required to retrieve and safeguard any such information that has already been obtained by and shared or transferred by DOGE or individuals associated with it.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 17, Judge Randolph Moss denied the TRO on the grounds that mere “access” to data by government employees who are not formally authorized to view it, without more, does not create an irreparable injury. He wrote that courts find dissemination of information to be an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information will be made public or is given to someone with no obligation to keep it confidential. He also wrote that irreparable harm was not present because plaintiffs would have a private right of action and money damages for certain unauthorized disclosures.",

The plaintiffs argue that the disclosure violates federal law, violates their constitutional rights, puts them at risk of identity theft, and goes beyond the agencies’ scope of authority. They have asked the court to declare the disclosures unlawful and stop the agencies from sharing and accessing the information. The court denied their request to block DOGE’s access because the possible scenarios for harm were too speculative.  \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Doe 1 (a federal employee), sued, claiming that the transmission of these records violated the plaintiffs’ right to privacy and puts plaintiffs at risk of identity theft and financial crimes.

Doe 1 also seeks an award of statutory and punitive damages. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO to enjoin Treasury and OPM defendants from providing DOGE access to information systems, to  enjoin DOGE defendants from accessing information systems, and to require status reports.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Judge Rossie D. Alston, Jr. issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order converting the motion for a TRO to a motion for a preliminary injunction, and denying the motion. Judge Alston wrote, “Plaintiffs’ fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief” based on the record before the court.

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Gwynne Wilcox (a member of the National Labor Relations Board) sued President Donald Trump challenging her removal from the National Labor Relations Board as a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, claiming that Trump did not meet the standard required for Wilcox’s removal under federal law and that Wilcox was not given notice and a hearing to contest her removal. \nCase Summary: This case challenges President Trump’s removal of Gwynne A. Wilcox from her position on the National Labor Relations Board.  The suit alleges the removal is in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.), which allows the president to remove Board members only in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance and only after notice and hearing. The Plaintiff is seeking relief under the Declaratory Judgement Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, to establish that she remains a rightful member of the Board and that the President lacks authority to remove her.

A federal judge allowed him to resume his position while the case proceeded through the courts. The Supreme Court rejected the government’s appeal of this decision on February 21. On March 5, 2025, the DC Circuit Court issued a 3-0 decision that effectively removed Dellinger from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the following day Dellinger dropped his case. \nCase Summary: Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger has been the Special Counsel in the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) since Mar. 6, 2024, when he was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. The OSC is an independent federal agency founded by Congress as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Its primary function is to protect federal employees and others who come forward as whistleblowers. Once confirmed, the Special Counsel serves a five-year term and “may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” On Feb. 7, 2025, Dellinger received a two-sentence email from Sergio Gor, informing Dellinger that he was terminated, effective immediately, and stating no cause for such termination. Dellinger is suing under six different counts and seeks a declaratory judgment that President Trump’s decision to fire him was unlawful, that the Special Counsel may only be removed for cause; and seeks an order that Dellinger may not be removed and is entitled to backpay. As precedent for the constitutionality of the statutory for-cause protection, Dellinger cites to Humphrey’s Executor.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued an administrative stay on Dellinger’s termination through midnight on February 13, 2025, while the parties submit their briefs.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 11, 2025, defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5025), making an emergency motion to stay the district court’s administrative stay. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 12, 2025, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 12, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the D.C. District Court granted a temporary restraining order, ordering that Dellinger shall continue to serve as Special Counsel and prohibiting defendants from denying him the resources and materials of his office.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 13, Defendants filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5028). In the District Court, their motion for a stay pending appeal was denied.\nUpdate 6: On Feb. 15, the D.C. Circuit rejected the Defendant’s appeal in a 2-1 opinion. \nUpdate 7: The Government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Justices to freeze and vacate the district court order that had temporarily reinstated Dellinger.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 21, the Supreme Court rejected (7-2) the Government’s petition on the ground that a TRO was not properly subject to appeal at this stage.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 26, Judge Jackson extended the TRO ordering that Dellinger remain as Special Counsel for an additional three days until she “complete[s] the written opinion on the consolidated motion for preliminary injunction and cross motions for summary judgment” (indicating she will rule on that day, Mar. 1).\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 1, Judge Jackson issued an Opinion and Order in favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendants immediately appealed to the DC Circuit.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 5, the DC Circuit in a 3-0 decision put a halt to the district court order pending the appeal. “This order gives effect to the removal of [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,” the DC Circuit wrote.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 6, Dellinger announced that he was dropping his case.\nFinal Update: CASE CLOSED",

The unions argue that the efforts are unconstitutional, violate federal law, and exceed the scope of agency authority. The unions have asked the court to declare the administration’s actions unlawful and unconstitutional, and immediately stop the administration’s efforts by appointing an independent administrator, restoring funding, and voiding the suspension of employees. The court initially stopped the administration from suspending employees but did not restore funding; however, the court has now denied the unions’ requests and reversed its earlier restrictions on the administration, on the basis that the dispute could be resolved outside of the court. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. Later, Secretary of State Rubio was named as acting USAID Administrator and USAID contractors were laid off or furloughed. On Feb. 3, Elon Musk posted that he had spent the previous weekend “feeding USAID to the woodchipper,” and USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. was closed. On Feb. 4, a message was posted on the USAID website that all directly-hired USAID staff would be placed on administrative leave as of 11:59pm EST on Friday, Feb. 7, 2025. Plaintiffs sued, arguing executive actions either to dissolve USAID or merge it with the State Department are unconstitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause; and unlawful under of the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding statutory authority, violating the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, and involving arbitrary and capricious abuses of discretion. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the administration’s actions are unlawful and unconstitutional; a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the administration to halt efforts to shut down the agency, including by appointing an independent administrator, restoring grant funding, recalling furloughs, and halting efforts to place more employees on administrative leave, among other actions. Plaintiffs also seek court supervision, and a permanent injunction barring the administration from taking action to dissolve USAID absent congressional authorization.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, 2025, Judge Carl J. Nichols issued a temporary restraining order preventing USAID from placing employees on administrative leave or evacuating them. He rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a restraining order on the funding freeze on the ground that the plaintiffs (USAID employees) could not show sufficient harm to themselves. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court extended the TRO until Friday, Feb. 21, at 11:59 PM. Judge Nichols also amended the TRO’s statement to clarify that no USAID employees can be involuntarily evacuated from their host countries while the TRO remains in place.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, the Government submitted a declaration by Pete Marocco, who performs the duties and functions of both Deputy Administrators of USAID; the declaration responds to the court’s questions about government actions to protect USAID employees abroad subject to administrative leave or in the event of employees staying voluntarily beyond the time of an evacuation. \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 21, Judge Nichols issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion rejecting the preliminary injunction and dissolving the TRO. His reasoning included that plaintiffs do not face irreparable harm after a series of concessions from Deputy Administrator Marocco, and that they could pursue remedies with administrative bodies governing disputes",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: Two nonprofit organizations sued the Trump administration over the suspension of United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”) funding. The organizations argue that the suspensions have harmed their work and employees, exceed the President’s scope of authority, and violate the Constitution. The organizations have asked the court to declare the suspension unlawful, immediately reinstate funding, and stop enforcement of the suspension. The court stopped the enforcement of a blanket suspension of funding but did not stop the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169) which affects employment and contracts. The organizations subsequently argued that the administration failed to comply with the order, to which the court ordered enforcement on the administration but did not expressly acknowledge any noncompliance. The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants.\nPlaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN), sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the implementation of the Executive Order and the stop-work order.  Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants from USAID to support their work. Both AVAC’s and JDN’s  funding was appropriated by Congress through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. Plaintiffs allege the Executive Order and stop-work order have been detrimental to their work, forcing them to lay off staff, slashing their budgets, and impacting their ability to carry out their missions. They allege the President acted ultra vires and usurped legislative authority. They also allege the President has violated the Take Care Clause. Plaintiffs’ claims against the State Department, USAID, Secretary of State Marc Rubio, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and OMB Director Vought are that the stop-work orders are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act (as an “unlawful reserve”), and the Impoundment Control Act. Plaintiffs seek a declaration from the court that the suspension of foreign aid is unlawful, an injunction stopping defendants from enforcing the Executive Order, and an order to immediately reinstate foreign assistance funding.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining Defendants from enforcing the Executive Order and State Department policy, enjoining stop-work orders, and reinstating foreign assistance funding and administration.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and Global Health Council v. Trump on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for contempt seeking to enforce the Feb. 13 TRO against Defendants and hold them in civil contempt. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ purported compliance with the TRO “strains credulity” and that Defendants have continued to suspend funding and enforce stop-work orders in violation of the court’s orders.  \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for enforcement of the court’s TRO “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” but did not make a finding of contempt, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.” The granted motion applies to this case and Global Health Council v. Trump.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 24, plaintiffs in Global Health Council v. Trump filed an emergency renewed motion to enforce the TRO. The court held a hearing the following day and, on Feb. 25, granted the motion for a proposed order requiring the Administration pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests for work completed prior to the TRO, as well as reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The court further mandated that the Administration take no actions to impede and must ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds going forward. The court also reportedly ordered the government to provide the court, by Feb. 26 at noon, with all internal directives to agency employees concerning compliance with the TRO. \nUpdate 6: On Feb. 25, the Government submitted a notice of its decision to appeal the court’s decision to the DC Circuit, and a motion to stay the court’s order pending appeal.\nUpdate 7: On Feb. 26, the district court rejected and the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Government’s motion for a stay.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 26, the Government filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court (while the decision before the D.C. Circuit was still pending) to vacate the district court’s TRO and grant an immediate administrative stay. That evening, Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay and ordered a response by the plaintiffs by Feb. 28 at 12:p.m. EST.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 28, the Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the application.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 5, the Supreme Court rejected the Defendants’ petition in a 5-4 decision.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 6, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled from the bench that the government must make outstanding balances to the Plaintiffs by Mar. 10; but did not resolve the payments for foreign aid recipients other than the Plaintiffs, which total near $2 billion.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 10, Judge Ali granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but he did not reject the State Department’s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. He ruled that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the claim that the latter actions flowed from the original government directives in violation of the law. \n",

                            "case_summary": "Overview: A group of organizations sued the Trump administration for defunding the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”), laying off employees, and attempting to dismantle the agency. The group argues that these actions violated the Constitution and federal laws, and exceeded the authority of the agencies and the President. The group has asked the court to void all actions taken by the administration, and stop the administration from implementing the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169). The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. \nCase Summary: A group of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that contract with USAID sued the Trump administration over its recent actions to defund USAID, lay off or furlough employees, and transfer the Agency to be under the State Department. Plaintiffs provide a detailed chronology of the actions, memoranda, and statements that the Administration has issued. In addition to imperiling future projects by freezing future funds, plaintiffs also allege that there is money unpaid for services already performed. ($3,376,832 for Democracy International, approximately $120 million for DAI, $103.6 million for Chemonics, and tens of millions for SBAIC’s members.) Plaintiffs allege that neither the President, nor the Secretary of State, nor the USAID Administrator have the authority to unilaterally withhold already-appropriated funds, citing the Constitution and statutory law prohibiting the unilateral withholding: the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act. Plaintiffs also claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the Executive’s actions were arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to statutory and constitutional law. Plaintiffs ask the court to vacate and set aside all of the defendants’ actions to implement Executive Order 14169 and seek injunctions to prevent defendants from continuing to implement EO 14169 and from “dismantling USAID.”\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and State Department Memorandum.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for enforcement of the court’s TRO “to the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,” but did not make a finding of contempt, citing “Defendants’ explicit recognition that ‘prompt compliance with the order’ is required.” The granted motion applies to this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State. \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 24, plaintiffs filed an emergency renewed motion to enforce the TRO. The court held a hearing the following day and, on Feb. 25, granted the motion for a proposed order requiring the Administration pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests for work completed prior to the TRO, as well as reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The court further mandated that the Administration take no actions to impede and must ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds going forward. The court also reportedly ordered the government to provide the court, by Feb. 26 at noon, with all internal directives to agency employees concerning compliance with the TRO. \nUpdate 5: On Feb. 25, the Government submitted a notice of its decision to appeal the court’s decision to the DC Circuit, and a motion to stay the court’s order pending appeal.\nUpdate 6: On Feb. 26, the district court rejected and the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Government’s motion for a stay.\nUpdate 7: On Feb. 26, the Government filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court (while the decision before the D.C.

That evening, Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay and ordered a response by the plaintiffs by Feb. 28 at 12:p.m. EST.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 28, the Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the application.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 5, the Supreme Court rejected the Defendants’ petition in a 5-4 decision.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 6, Judge Amir H.

They seek both an immediate temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to prevent USAID's dismantling and the freezing of congressionally appropriated foreign assistance funds.On Mar. 6, a federal judge denied the contractors’ request for the temporary restraining order.  \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in “foreign development assistance,” and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. \nThe Personal Services Contractor Association filed suit on Feb. 18, 2025, challenging Executive Order 14169 and subsequent actions that effectively suspended U.S. foreign aid and began dismantling USAID. The plaintiffs, representing USAID contractors, allege these actions have caused severe disruption, including contractors being locked out of facilities and email, facing eviction overseas, losing access to healthcare, and being unable to carry out humanitarian aid work. The plaintiffs bring four causes of action: (1) violation of separation of powers against Trump, (2) violation of the Take Care Clause against Trump, (3) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for arbitrary and capricious actions against all defendants except Trump, and (4) violation of the APA for actions not in accordance with law (including under the Impoundment Act and Anti-Deficiency Act) against all defendants except Trump. The plaintiffs seek both immediate temporary relief (to restore USAID contractors to their pre-January 20 employment status and work conditions) and permanent injunctive relief to prevent USAID's dismantling, its absorption into the State Department, and the freezing of congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funds without congressional approval. They also request ongoing compliance monitoring through regular status reports.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order, including 13 Declarations as Exhibits. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 6, Judge Carl Nichols ruled from the bench denying the contractors' request for the temporary restraining order. Judge Nichols said the complaints should be adjudicated by the board of contract appeals or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

The NED was established by the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983. In the Act, Congress specified that the NED would be funded by annual congressional appropriations, which would then be disbursed to the Endowment via grants from the Department of State. The statute also prescribes that the Endowment must withdraw funds from an account held by the Department of Treasury on an as-needed basis.\nThe complaint alleges that for the past month, “the Executive Branch has denied the Endowment access to its congressionally appropriated funds—something that has never occurred before in the Endowment’s forty-two-year existence.” As a result, the Endowment claims it is “experiencing a devastating cash flow crisis that jeopardizes its ability to fulfill its mission and its very existence, as well as that of its core institutes and grantees.” The complaint alleges that the Executive Branch is obligated by the NED Act to grant the funds appropriated by Congress, and by not doing so, it is acting “contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority because the statutory scheme creates a mandatory, non-discretionary duty for Defendants to make available, obligate, and disburse the Endowment’s congressionally appropriated funds.” The complaint argues that the administration’s actions constitute an “unlawful impoundment” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the All Writs Act, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Separation of Powers. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring Defendants from impounding the Endowment’s funds.",

A federal judge ordered the Administration to stop deleting and removing records, terminating employees without cause, or disbursing funds except for operating expenses, while the case proceeds. \nCase Summary: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by Congress in the aftermath of the 2007–2008 great recession, to support and protect American consumers in the financial marketplace. On Feb. 7, 2025, Elon Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a tombstone emoji on his X account. On Feb. 8, Russell Vought, the Acting Director of the CFPB, posted on X that he had notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB would not take “its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not ‘reasonably necessary’ to carry out its duties.” In an email to CFPB employees, Vought directed the CFPB workforce to “cease all supervision and examination activity,” “cease all stakeholder engagement,” pause all pending investigations, not issue any public communications, and pause “enforcement actions.” He also notified the CFPB workforce that the Washington headquarters would be closed for the coming week. Plaintiffs allege that preventing CFPB from drawing down more funding and ordering a halt on enforcement activities constitutes an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress’s decision to create CFPB, which would be a violation of the separation of powers. They seek a declaratory judgment that Vought’s directives are unlawful and an injunction that prevents him from further attempts to dismantle CFPB’s supervision and enforcement work.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Plaintiffs moved for an administrative stay and TRO enjoining defendants from taking action to terminate CFPB staff, requiring that cease work directives be lifted, and enjoining further efforts to suspend operations at CFPB.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, 2025, the court ordered that the defendants not delete, destroy, remove, or impair records; terminate any employee other than for cause or issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee; or disburse any funds, except to satisfy CFPB’s operating obligations, pending the resolution of plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO.

A federal judge reportedly told the Inspectors General to withdraw their request to continue in their roles while the case proceeds. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 24, 2025, the White House sent two-sentence emails to several Inspectors General (IGs) of federal departments and agencies informing them that they had been terminated from their positions. Plaintiffs, eight IGs, subsequently lost access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and were barred from entering their offices, among other actions. They filed suit, arguing their removal violates the Inspector General Act, which requires Congressional notification 30 days before an IG is removed and substantive, case-specific rationale for removal.

A federal judge reportedly told the Inspectors General to withdraw their request to continue in their roles while the case proceeds.</em><br/><br/> <br>\n<strong>Case Summary:</strong> On Jan. 24, 2025, the White House sent two-sentence emails to several Inspectors General (IGs) of federal departments and agencies informing them that they had been terminated from their positions. Plaintiffs, eight IGs, subsequently lost access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and were barred from entering their offices, among other actions. They filed suit, arguing their removal violates the Inspector General Act, which requires Congressional notification 30 days before an IG is removed and substantive, case-specific rationale for removal. The suit also argues defendants’ actions are ultra vires; and that plaintiffs are entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling defendants not to obstruct them in the exercise of their duties. They seek a declaratory judgment that the termination emails are legally ineffective and that plaintiffs remain lawful IGs in their agencies; and an injunction to prevent defendants from taking action to prevent plaintiffs from carrying out their duties as IGs.<br>\n<strong>Update 1:</strong> On Feb. 14, the judge <strong>reportedly</strong> told lawyers representing the fired inspectors general to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order.</br></br>",

Probationary employees are members of the competitive service in their first year of employment or of the excepted service in their first two years of employment, and may also include long-time federal workers who have recently been employed in a new position or a new agency.\nAmong the factual claims, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants sent agencies “standardized notices of termination, drafted by OPM, that falsely state that the terminations are for performance reasons.” Plaintiffs allege that the mass termination violates multiple requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act and separation of powers principles by overriding Congressional statutes authorizing and regulating agency hiring and firing. They seek a declaration that the mass termination is unlawful and a preliminary or permanent injunction setting aside OPM’s order, ceasing terminations pursuant to the order, and rescinding any prior unlawful terminations.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 23, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that OPM further violated the APA by sending emails to government employees requesting updates on their week-to-week accomplishments and Musk’s stating that “[f]ailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 27, Judge William Alsup reportedly ruled from the bench that OPM had no legal authority to issue directives for other  agencies to fire probationary employees. Alsup noted that, due to jurisdictional issues, his order applies only to employees at six agencies (the National Park Service, National Science Foundation, Small Business Administration, Bureau of Land Management, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense), and that he could not directly order agencies to cease  the firings. As for other agencies not covered, Alsup said, “I am going to count on the government to do the right thing, and to go a little bit further than I have ordered, and to let some of these agencies know what I have ruled.”\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 28, Judge Alsup issued an Opinion and a written Order for a TRO. The Order states that OPM’s memos directing the termination of probationary workers were “unlawful, invalid, and must be stopped and rescinded,” and that OPM must provide written notice of the order to the six agencies.

On the same day, the White House Press Secretary stated, “This is not a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 3, 2025, Judge Alikhan issued a temporary restraining order blocking the OMB from implementing its funding freeze, finding that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the directive was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and that the post-complaint rescission of the memorandum was “disingenuous”  and still causing irreparable injury. The order directed the OMB to release the frozen funds, notify agencies of this TRO, and file a status report on compliance by Feb. 7, 2025.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Trump Administration from reinstating the funding freeze. The Government filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion, and plaintiffs replied. The hearing was held on Feb. 20.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 25, the court issued a memorandum opinion and granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Trump administration from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the blanket freeze on disbursement of Federal funds.

None of these communications identified specific programs or funds that would be terminated, and none cited any legal authority.

                            "case_summary": "On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order prohibiting the federal government from expending federal funds to promote “gender ideology,” the idea that gender identity can differ from biological sex. On January 28, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the federal government to bar medical institutes that receive research and education grants, including medical schools and hospitals, from administering gender affirming care to individuals under the age of 19. The order also ended coverage for gender affirming care in government-provided medical benefits, and ordered the Office of Management and Budget to instruct private health insurers that government employee plans were barred from covering such care.

First, they claim that Defendants violated the Administrative Leave Act by placing Plaintiffs on leave for more than ten work days, despite the fact that no worker misconduct had been alleged. Second, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act, because Plaintiffs’ “imminent termination” is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with [Intelligence Community] regulations, and unsupported by any evidentiary record whatsoever.” Third, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the First and Fifth Amendments by firing Plaintiffs on the basis of “their assumed beliefs about a domestic political issue [DEIA]” and causing them to lose “their property interest in their employment without due process of law.”\nThe plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.

On Jan. 21, the administration issued a third executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. \n\nPlaintiffs are arts nonprofit corporations that have received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Pursuant to the Jan. 20 “gender ideology” EO, the NEA now requires all grant applicants to certify their understanding that “federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.” Plaintiffs, who seek to “affirm transgender and nonbinary identities and experiences in the projects for which they seek funding,” allege that such projects now appear to be ineligible for NEA funding, and the vagueness of the new NEA policy “requires [Plaintiffs] to guess as to what if anything they can create, produce, or promote that addresses themes of gender.” The Plaintiffs claim that the NEA’s “gender ideology” prohibition exceeds statutory authority under the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the prohibition violates the First and Fifth Amendments by imposing vague and viewpoint-based restrictions on artistic speech.

The executive order directs various agencies to impose sanctions against the firm, including: terminating the firm’s government contracts; suspending employees’ security clearances pending a national-security review; ordering a review of the firm’s hiring practices by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; limiting employees’ access to federal buildings; and directing agencies not to hire Perkins Coie employees. \n\nThe Plaintiff sued, alleging that the executive action is unconstitutional, violating separation of powers, the First Amendment’s protections for freedom of speech and association, the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. They seek a declaratory judgment that the order is unconstitutional and an immediate injunction stopping implementation of the order pending court review, followed by preliminary and permanent injunctions.\n\nThe Plaintiff also submitted a request for a temporary restraining order and a proposed order that enjoined only Sections 1 (Purpose), 3 (Contracting), and 5 (Personnel including access to Federal Government buildings) of the executive order. \n\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, Judge Beryl Howell, ruling from the bench, granted Perkins Coie’s request for a temporary restraining order to block Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the executive order. She reportedly noted that the Plaintiff had not requested the TRO apply to Section 2 (Security Clearances) and Section 4 (Racial Discrimination) of the executive order, although those sections are also part of the lawsuit.",

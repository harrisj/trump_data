There is a theory that Trump needs to go to one of his properties so frequently
because he is a "home pooper." Regardless, this dataset will collect all the
times Trump went to one of his properties

The source for this is [Roll Call's White House Calendar](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/calendar/) on Factbase. There is also an automated scraper that looks at this data to pull out golf trips. Please note that sometimes it can take a few days for the golf trips to be properly annotated.
